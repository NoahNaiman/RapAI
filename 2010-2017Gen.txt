Die Jay Z, Noah “40” Shebib & Daxz
They want me to give you some second thoughts
And you and your pants
That’s right, I’m in the hills, I hang with Elz
Well, bitch, if you fuck them hoes, a championship win is
Probably go to St. Tropez
Guess that's what the deal ridaz?
Be honest, none of your words, ayy
I been through more than she think I like em long haired and curvy
How great how great is our party
Saying I just want our equality
Now I ain't got the key to every mothafucking city
Oh what a pity!
This is a waste ting, shorty
I can appreciate where your nose high society
Bitch, that was a B-list celebrity
Respect my mind on your last fifty
Niggas please be empty
Word on the Patty
In terms of the ocean getting shark pussy
And that just mean controversy
But I'mma give you the summary
That’s out of they history
For you to see all of the mother country
Lil hoes you went and chose a field nigga, go shine cutlery
Mind's like a semi or a missionary
I made a flower bloomed in a hurry?
She shallow, but the tidbits vary
I'm on the beat, fuck the world; that's adultery
The future is in danger, ten Mississippi
I was so uptight, but now the boy
Most of y'all niggas build to destroy
I already know I'd kill for joy
Then a private school for my money
Do you believe in gravity, honey
Put the chrome to your worst enemy
But she don't suck dick, dummy?
Got a Hennessy in my court and it’s lonely
On a fast brother, with a purple Bentley
You a goofy especially
We don't do the same as mine is gonna shine positively
You know that she may be as mentally and physically
They don't want more than it was definitely
And I thank God, suddenly
My chain already heavy, don't let the only
Who just happen to think logically
There's no place you can take it personally
That your love and emotion endlessly
I taste temptation and I lack empathy
You tell me if I would testify
They see a Harley
Pour a little when I'm in LA with Lindsay
Let me see your insecurities written all on the daily
Got a pretty penny
Uh, I need to organize a pep rally
Wait one minute I walked to the young and unlucky
But least a nigga on a day early
Tryna give your journey mercy
You don’t know, you gonna say to the kidney
It’s a cold ass honkey!”
I could blow, fire in Cali will swallow a valley
Is this the finale
Don't come in through the empty alley
Yeah, what you could've been somebody
They don't know already
And all my bitches down for a daddy
I'll be goddamned if another rapper lose custody
Every one of your body
When I take the time I love you, Doody
Homie, I’ll never forget it, war ready
And some of you and Am should ménage Friday
Tell me when you need to hear those stories bout his lady
Shit this is what you make me fancy
Nigga make way for me to bust up the lights in here, baby
Claiming I'm just bad for Bill Cosby?
You need to treat you like the Kentucky Derby
Clean up the game up in my DNA
When shit hit the highway
But don't fall asleep on me, I’m bout to slam on the freeway
Blew up and cock it and spray
Ask me why, man, I had her saddest day
White hoes in the streets, say
Murda on the side? I have to grow up in my way
Unfortunately I am today
But gravity had me on my mind or die from lead shower. I pray
America, please take my food stamps away
The way he left my bags at the spot every Sunday
See my name did not sign with Jay
But there's nowhere to stay
Hang my laundry in the dark night, I been drinking, ay ay
Your natural hair and hold the door for her girl birthday
Cause in this bitch like a Groundhog's Day
Just to come like payday
Sweetie tell me who in here say:
But I refuse to believe in yesterday
Can't believe they got so many fresh everyday
Back it up, baby, come and play
All worries in a Hyundai
I'm always on that track with Gunplay
Now you're throwing it back and told her, “Get away”
You can wish on all the time, every night, hey
Fuck SNL and the USA
You'll just make me give you what you're doing, ok?
But I don't wanna be friends with the runway
Wonder if you're okay
It'll be like this was Broadway
I guess I'm a sensei
Pull up in Equinox
Feds in the boondocks
And forever, we could have this moment will be mad at an ex
Two girls, gold spandex so pretty call that rough sex
White on white wagon, call that bitch and that's a complex
All praise to the climax
So there's more for them niggas, aww
And I thought you should call Mase so he could solo
It's Hov time in Mexico?
So in other words, I'm off the vertigo
This time I'm in that Monte Carlo
Sometimes the path I've chosen to go tomorrow?
Niggas'll rip your shit off in Chicago
And you could unswallow
Bite me, bitch, Geronimo
Ashed my blunt in my hands in the first rainbow
How can I do is smoke tobacco
Niggas ain't real as they come, BLAOOW
Got your man in the shadow
God in the grotto
You couldn't stand you
What if I wanted to
Too many Urkels on your head, woo!
I could tell, I could read the You
It's all in your psyche too
I guess that's why I'm so gifted at finding what I do
Lay it down, ooh
Cry, I'm not new
This ain't savage, you ain't shit you been through
Hello? Fuck you and your new bitch, boo boo
It’s a beautiful view
See, at this stage and tear it off in a tutu
If I ever knew
Boy I get a belt in two
People just get it get a lawn chair, hugh, hugh!
Up in the loo
And I'm way too good to be true.
Thought it would be untrue
Ducking your questions, fuck your position and make you—
Last name Fuck, first name I Don't Give a Fuck Avenue
I guess that's the monster shoe
Look at me, oooh
In other words I got 99 problems and a good jaw
Boss up, I'm the one, that told her suck a softball through a straw
Ayy don't try to fuck me over, ‘cause if I ever saw
If I don't need to unthaw
My bitch whip cost a hundred million and gave 20 to Hov
One time for my niggas bro
Now look you little ho
You don't want to go
I want your tickets when it's 20 below
This my jam, this my Wayne Perry flow
Got up the number, we chirped the whole dough
Because I murdered her, so you can take it though
And I know you ain't never did this before, no
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Now get up out the ghetto, you know you know
The twenty-something confusion before the Basquiat show
I got to, I gotta take time with the wind blow
Why you standing there with E and Tho
And if that pussy for me, I'm about to glow
How to love, nobody, no-
And I think I think they high as Heaven, eyes low
And I done said so
Ike Turner with the snow
30K on the news I'm bearing, whoa
Go-to guy for the freaks and for my day slow
Just make the best row
But you should know you—I'll get to witness your grandbabies grow
That's me in my bio
As blood spilled on your back in proper context
I need to cool out
Still at it, do it, do my thank you's for the pay cut
That ain't what they talking about?
People like Mazin who was once in a nut
But I will change, but
Got a Kat Stacks with a line through it, slut!
This is the definition of what
It's hard but I'm too lazy to workout
She wake up, I need to see all of a poet
If you don't wanna be famous, but…
You know we got
So don't you place your left hand or not
It's not a fairytale, I already forgot
But I really wanted a jump shot
Have you any idea the shit come hot
I might hit the gym, step on the floor get caught
Love you, love you so trill, baby everything legit
Rest in peace to the money, I rest on them hoes like Pat Summitt
I got a lounge, just sit back, bitch get off the pot
I confess I'm a king ask Coretta Scott
Ass so fat, hit that same spot
Forty acres and a lot
Bushmills for a minute
I'm new to this angst
