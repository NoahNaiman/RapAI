We ain’t got 24s,
And I thought about you like my 24s,
Example of what I does,
We forget the happy thoughts,
About the only one in your pants,
Whatever you want your tickets when it's time to hang with Elz,
Back when I come back, like I’ll see what your name is?,
Want you to get his,
But right before my dick get big as Trey Songz,
You don't know who it is, watch what the deal ridaz?,
I just don't know the perks my work has,
So you be the alcohol, ayy,
Nigga dash like a movie,
When shit hit the sky, get the whole party,
Got so many times the city,
I got my bitches nasty,
The way that I'm irrelevant to society,
I done put blood on your last fifty,
She just want our equality,
Now, baby, when I'm around you, shawty,
