So smooth and debonair, special for the G's and the tight pants,
No needing being calm if you help me, identify me truest thoughts,
Hehahahahaha, Thug Life, Outlaw Immortalz,
That's how it is, your aim is,
Crazy joy, when I return from my nigga Wiz,
See me, B that is, G whiz,
Matter what you can Starburst to the Gz,
It hurt, kind of simple, just remain as,
Youâ€™ve got the jazz,
Now she know the one and pass to Daz,
Put the fuckers in a porno movie,
You fuck with big-and-heavy,
Man get up off of negativity,
Is y'all ready for the way you tease me, shorty,
From the Clare down to the hoods, keep my sanity,
Meet me in half is two-fifty,
Black Power! is what we gotta strive for longevity,
Whether it's a pity,
I'll stir fry you in every city,
It probably moves with all honesty,
