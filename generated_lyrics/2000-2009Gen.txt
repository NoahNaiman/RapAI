Oh, now you sober, how'd I know you, Slim, no one does,
If you don't like this is,
And you're known to handle biz,
Let's give it to any singer in showbiz,
I's just me, no m√°s,
I'm like, shit what the surgeon says,
They call me as,
Now true enough I was gonna put out bullshit joints like AZ,
Here's what you thought Little Wayne was Weezy,
I can't take it all up, there's no movie,
There's a lot of envy,
Never was a scarlet party,
But see me sittin on top of the city,
Come off tour, can't even make a hook like shorty,
See, I'm a prime candidate for the fact that humanity,
But you gave me this moment of honesty,
Better go capture this moment of clarity,
Than the park bench to start our own fraternity,
But I know it I'm guilty,
Mad at me, I'm awkward, I box lefty,
