Young Rascal Flatts. Young ass kid ass could rap

Back-to-back packin' bags back and forth with fifths of Jack and
Fourths of weed, I 'm back to pack on hands
With young Cletus to pat my back.
Real nigga with a nose ring, that's right
Just here to rap them songs.
Rag on my hair, wrap weed in Vegas, rockin' Vagabonds.
Sang a song, oh you don't know? What?

Hang with you, sip drank with you
As long as I can sang with you like:

Listen
Seein' you got ritualistic
Cleansin' my soul of addiction for now
'Cause I 'm fallin' apart, yeah. Tension
Between us just like picket fences
You got issues that I won't mention for now
'Cause we're fallin' apart.

Passionate from miles away
Passive with the things you say
Passin' up on my old ways
I can't blame you, no, no
Passionate from miles away
Passive with the things you say
Passin' up on my old ways
I can't blame you, no, no.

Listen
Harder buildin' trust from a distance
I think we should rule out commitment for now
'Cause we're fallin' apart. Leavin'
You're just doing that to get even
Don't pick up the pieces, just leave it for now
They keep fallin' apart.

Passionate from miles away
Passive with the things you say
Passin' up on my old ways
I can't blame you, no, no
Passionate from miles away
Passive with the things you say
Passin' up on my old ways
I can't blame you, no, no.

Um, trying to think of the right thing to say
You used to call me on my
You used to, you used to
Yeah.

You used to call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
Call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love. And I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing.

Ever since I left the city, you
Got a reputation for yourself now
Everybody knows and I feel left out
Girl, you got me down, you got me stressed out
‘Cause ever since I left the city, you
Started wearing less and goin' out more
Glasses of champagne out on the dance floor
Hangin' with some girls I never seen before.

You used to call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
Call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love. I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing.

Ever since I left the city, you, you, you
You and me, we just don't get along
You make me feel like I did you wrong
Going places where you don't belong
Ever since I left the city, you
You got exactly what you asked for
Running out of pages in your passport
Hangin' with some girls I've never seen before.

You used to call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
Call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love. And I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing.

These days, all I do is
Wonder if you're bendin' over backwards for someone else
Wonder if you're rolling up a Backwoods for someone else. Doing things I taught you, gettin' nasty for someone else
You don't need no one else
You don't need nobody else, no. Why you never alone? 
Why you always touching road? 
Used to always stay at home
Be a good girl, you was in the zone
Yeah, you should just be yourself
Right now, you're someone else.

You used to call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
Call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love. And I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing.

Ever since I left the city…
Baby, I like your style.

Grips on your waist, front way, back way. You know that I don't play
Streets not safe but I never run away
Even when I 'm away. Oti, oti
There's never much love when we go OT
I pray to make it back in one piece
I pray, I pray.

That's why I need a one dance
Got a Hennessy in my hand
One more time'fore I go
Higher powers taking a hold on me
I need a one dance
Got a Hennessy in my hand
One more time'fore I go
Higher powers taking a hold on me

Baby, I like your style.

Strength and guidance
All that I 'm wishing for my friends. Nobody makes it from my ends
I had to bust up the silence. You know you gotta stick by me
Soon as you see the text, reply me
I don't wanna spend time fighting
We've got no time.

And that's why I need a one dance
Got a Hennessy in my hand
One more time'fore I go
Higher powers taking a hold on me
I need a one dance
Got a Hennessy in my hand
One more time'fore I go
Higher powers taking a hold on me.

Got a pretty girl and she love me long time

Back up, back up and wine it, girl
Back up, back up, back up and wine it
Oh yeah, very long time
Back, up, back up and wine it, girl.

Tell me
I need to know, where do you wanna go? 
Cause if you're down, I 'll take it slow
Make you lose control
Where, where, where
Where, where, where, where. Oh yeah, very long time
Where, where, where
Back, up, back up and wine it, girl
Where, where, where, where
Cause if you're down
Back up, back up and
Cause if you're down
Back up, back up and
Cause if you're down
Back up, back up and.

One more time'fore I go
Higher powers taking a hold on me
I need a one dance
Got a Hennessy in my hand
One more time'fore I go
Higher powers taking a hold on me
Look...I don't know how to talk to you
I don't know how to ask you if you're okay. My friends always feel the need to tell me things
Seems like they're just happier than us these days. Yeah, these days I don't know how to talk to you
I don't know how to be there when you need me
I t feels like the only time you see me
I s when you turn your head to the side and look at me differently.

Yeah, and last night I think I lost my patience
Last night, I got high as your expectations
Last night, I came to a realization
And I hope you can take it
I hope you can take it.

I 'm too good to you
I 'm way too good to you
You take my love for granted
I just don't understand it
No, I 'm too good to you
I 'm way too good to you
You take my love for granted
I just don't understand it.

I don't know how to talk to you
I just know I found myself getting lost with you. Lately you just make me work too hard for you. Got me on flights overseas, and I still can't get across to you.

And last night I think I lost my patience
Last night, I got high as your expectations
Last night, I came to a realization
And I hope you can take it
I hope you can take it.

I'm too good to you
I 'm way too good to you
You take my love for granted
I just don't understand it

No, I 'm too good to you
I 'm way too good to you
You take my love for granted
I just don't understand it. Years go by too fast
I can't keep track
How long did we last? 
I feel bad for asking
I t can't end like this
We gotta take time with this. Cock up yuh bumper, sit down pon it
Let me see if this is something I can fix. You got somebody other than me
Don't play the victim when you're with me
Free time is costing me more than it seems
Sacrificing things. And I wanna tell you my intentions
I wanna do the things that I mention
I wanna benefit from the friendship
I wanna get the late night message from you, from you. I put my hands around you
Gotta get a handle on you
Gotta get a handle on the fact that...

I'm too good to you
I 'm way too good to you
You take my love for granted
I just don't understand it
No, I 'm too good to you
I 'm way too good to you
You take my love for granted
I just don't understand it

Gyal a you mi waan

Baby, cock up yuh bumper, sit down pon it
Gyal yo pum pum good and yuh fit

And in my pocket
Cock up yuh bumper, sit down pon it
Gyal yo pum pum good and yuh fit
Mi wi give you everything weh deh in my wallet
And in my pocket
Now this shit's about to kick off, this party looks wack.
Let's take it back to straight hip-hop and start it from scratch.
I 'm'bout to bloody this track up, everybody get back.
That's why my pen needs a pad, ‘cause my rhymes on the rag.
Just like I did with addiction, I 'm'bout to kick it.
Like a magician, critics I turn to crickets.
Got'em still on the fence whether to picket.
But quick to get it impaled when I tell'em . Stick it!
So sick I 'm looking pale, wait, that's my pigment
'Bout to go ham, ya bish, shout out to Kendrick.
Let's bring it back to that vintage Slim, bitch!
The art of MCing mixed with da Vinci and MC Ren.
And I don't mean Stimpy's friend, bitch.
Been Public Enemy since you thought PE was gym, bitch.

Kick your shoes off, let your hair down
all night long
Grow your beard out, just weird out
all night long. We're gonna rock this house until we knock it down
So turn the volume loud
‘Cause it's mayhem'til the A.M.
So, baby, make just like K-Fed
And let yourself go, let yourself go.
Say Fuck it before we kick the bucket.
Life's too short to not go for broke.
So everybody, everybody, go berserk, grab your vial, yeah.

Guess it's just the way that I 'm dressed, ain't it? 
Khakis pressed, Nike shoes crispy and fresh laced.
So I guess it ain't that aftershave
Or cologne that made'em just faint.
Plus I showed up with a coat fresher than wet paint.
So if love is a chess game, check mate.
But girl, your body's bangin', jump me in, dang, bang-bang.
Yes siree'Bob', I was thinking the same thang.
So come get on this Kid's rock, baw with da baw, dang-dang.
Pow-p-p-p-pow, chica, pow, chica, wow-wow.
Got your gal blowin' up a valve, valve-valve.
Ain't slowin' down, throw in the towel, towel-towel.
Dumb it down, I don't know how, huh-huh, how-how.
At least I know that I don't know.
Question is, are you bozos smart enough to feel stupid?
Hope so, now ho…

Kick your shoes off, let your hair down
all night long
Grow your beard out, just weird out
all night long. We're gonna rock this house until we knock it down
So turn the volume loud
‘Cause it's mayhem'til the A.M.
So, baby, make just like K-Fed
And let yourself go, let yourself go.
Say Fuck it before we kick the bucket.
Life's too short to not go for broke.
So everybody, everybody, go berserk, grab your vial, yeah.

They say that love is powerful as cough syrup in styrofoam.
All I know is I fell asleep and woke up in that Monte Carlo.
With the ugly Kardashian, Lamar, oh
Sorry yo, we done both set the bar low.
Far as hard drugs are though, that's the past.
But I done did enough codeine to knock Future into tomorrow.
And girl, I ain't got no money to borrow
But I am tryin' to find a way to get you alone: car note.
Oh, Marshall Mathers
Shithead with a potty mouth, get the bar of soap lathered.
Kangol's and Carheartless Cargos. Girl, you're fixin' to get your heart broke.
Don't be absurd, ma'am, you birdbrain, baby
I ain't called anybody baby since Birdman, unless you're a swallow.
Word, Rick, word man, you heard. But don't get discouraged, girl.
This is your jam, unless you got toe jam.

Kick your shoes off, let your hair down
all night long
Grow your beard out, just weird out
all night long. We're gonna rock this house until we knock it down
So turn the volume loud
‘Cause it's mayhem'til the A.M.
So, baby, make just like K-Fed
And let yourself go, let yourself go.
Say Fuck it before we kick the bucket.
Life's too short to not go for broke.
So everybody, everybody, go berserk, grab your vial, yeah
Look, I was gonna go easy on you not to hurt your feelings..
But I 'm only going to get this one chance.
Something's wrong, I can feel it..
Six minutes. Six Minutes. Six minutes, Slim Shady, you're on!
Just a feeling I've got.
Like something is about to happen, but I don't know what.
If that means what I think it means, we're in trouble, big trouble; and if he is as bananas as you say, I 'm not taking any chances..
You are just what the doc ordered.

I 'm beginning to feel like a Rap God, Rap God.
All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod.
Now, who thinks their arms are long enough to slap box, slap box?
They said I rap like a robot, so call me Rap-bot
But for me to rap like a computer it must be in my genes
I got a laptop in my back pocket.
My pen'll go off when I half-cock it.
Got a fat knot from that rap profit.
Made a livin' and a killin' off it.
Ever since Bill Clinton was still in office
With Monica Lewinsky feelin' on his nutsack.
I'm an MC still as honest
But as rude and as indecent as all hell.
Syllables, skill-a-holic This flippity dippity-hippity hip-hop.
You don't really wanna get into a pissin' match
With this rappity brat, packin' a MAC in the back of the Ac'Backpack rap crap, yap-yap, yackety-yack
And at the exact same time I attempt these lyrical acrobat stunts while I 'm practicin' that.
I'll still be able to break a motherfuckin' table
Over the back of a couple of faggots, and crack it in half.
Only realized it was ironic, I was signed to Aftermath after the fact.
How could I not blow? All I do is drop F-bombs
Feel my wrath of attack.
Rappers are havin' a rough time period, here's a maxi pad.
It's actually disastrously bad for the wack.
While I 'm masterfully constructing this master piece

I 'm beginning to feel like a Rap God, Rap God
All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod.
Now, who thinks their arms are long enough to slap box, slap box?
Let me show you maintaining this shit ain't that hard, that hard.
Everybody want the key and the secret
To rap immortality like I have got

Well, to be truthful the blueprint's
Simply rage and youthful exuberance.
Everybody loves to root for a nuisance.
Hit the Earth like an asteroid.
Did nothing but shoot for the Moon since MC's get taken to school with this music
'Cause I use it as a vehicle to bust a rhyme
Now I lead a new school full of students. Me?
I'm a product of Rakim
Lakim Shabazz, 2Pac, N.W.A, Cube, hey Doc, Ren
Yella, Eazy, thank you, they got Slim
Inspired enough to one day grow up, blow up and be in a position
To meet Run–D.M.C. and induct them
I nto the motherfuckin' Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.
Even though I 'll walk in the church and burst in a ball of flames.
Only Hall of Fame I'll be inducted in is the alcohol of fame.
On the wall of shame
You fags think it's all a game, 'til I walk a flock of flames
Off a plank and, tell me what in the fuck are you thinkin'?
Little gay-looking boy
So gay I can barely say it with a straight face, looking boy.
You're witnessing a massacre
Like you're watching a church gathering take place, looking boy.
Oy vey, that boy's gay! , that's all they say, looking boy
You get a thumbs up, pat on the back.
And a way to go from your label every day, looking boy
Hey, looking boy!
What you say, looking boy?
I get a hell yeah from Dre, looking boy.
I'ma work for everything I have, never ask nobody for shit.
Get outta my face, looking boy!
Basically, boy, you're never gonna be capable
Of keeping up with the same pace, looking boy,'cause
I 'm beginning to feel like a Rap God, Rap God
All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod.
The way I 'm racing around the track, call me NASCAR, NASCAR
Dale Earnhardt of the trailer park, the White Trash God.
Kneel before General Zod
This planet's Krypton no, Asgard, Asgard

So you be Thor and I'll be Odin
You rodent, I'm omnipotent.
Let off, then I'm reloadin'
Immediately with these bombs I'm totin' And I should not be woken.
I'm the walking dead, but I'm just a talking head, a zombie floatin' I'm out my Ramen Noodle.
We have nothin' in common, poodle.
I'm a Doberman, pinch yourself in the arm and pay homage, pupil. 
It's me, my honesty's brutal.
But it's honestly futile if I don't utilize what I do though
For good at least once in a while.
So I wanna make sure, somewhere in this chicken scratch I scribble and doodle enough rhymes
To maybe try to help get some people through tough times.
But I gotta keep a few punchlines
Just in case,'cause even you unsigned
Rappers are hungry looking at me like it's lunchtime.
I know there was a time where once I 
Was king of the underground
But I still rap like I'm on my Pharaoh Munch grind.
So I crunch rhymes, but sometimes when you combine
Appeal with the skin color of mine.
You get too big and here they come tryin'
To censor you, like that one line
I said on. 
I'm Back from The Mathers LP 1 when I 
Tried to say I 'll take seven kids from Columbine
Put'em all in a line, add an AK-47, a revolver and a 9
See if I get away with it now that I ain't as big as I was, but I 'm
Morphin' into an immortal, comin' through the portal.
You're stuck in a time warp from 2004 though.
And I don't know what the fuck that you rhyme for.
You're pointless as Rapunzel with fuckin' cornrows.
You write normal?
Fuck being normal!
And I just bought a new raygun from the future
Just to come and shoot ya, like when Fabolous made Ray J mad
'Cause Fab said he looked like a fag at Mayweather's pad
Singin' to a man while they played piano.
Man, oh man, that was a 24/7 special on the cable channel
So Ray J went straight to the radio station
The very next day,
Hey Fab, I'ma kill you!
Lyrics comin' at you at supersonic speed
Uh, summa-lumma, dooma-lumma, you assumin' I'm a human.
What I gotta do to get it through to you?
I'm superhuman. 
Innovative and I
'm made of rubber, so that anything you say is ricocheting off of me and it'll glue to you and.
I'm devastating, more than ever demonstrating
How to give a motherfuckin' audience a feeling like it's levitating.
Never fading, and I know the haters are forever waiting.
For the day that they can say I fell off, they'll be celebrating'
Cause I know the way to get'em motivated.
I make elevating music, you make elevator music.
Oh, he's too mainstream.
Well, that's what they do when they get jealous, they confuse it.
It's not hip-hop, it's pop, because I found a hella way to fuse it.
With rock, shock rap with Doc.
Throw on Lose Yourself and make'em lose it.
I don't know how to make songs like that
I don't know what words to use..
Let me know when it occurs to you
While I 'm rippin' any one of these verses that versus you
It's curtains, I'm inadvertently hurtin' you.
How many verses I gotta murder to
Prove that if you were half as nice
Your songs you could sacrifice virgins to?
Ungh, school flunky, pill junkie
But look at the accolades these skills brung me.
Full of myself, but still hungry.
I bully myself 'cause I make me do what I put my mind to.
And I 'm a million leagues above you.
Ill when I speak in tongues, but it's still tongue-in-cheek, fuck you!
I'm drunk so Satan, take the fuckin' wheel! 
I'm asleep in the front seat.
Bumpin' Heavy D and the Boyz, still.
Chunky but Funky.
But in my head there's something I can feel tugging and struggling
Angels fight with devils, and here's what they want from me.
They're asking me to eliminate some of the women hate.
But if you take into consideration the bitter hatred.
I have, then you may be a little patient
And more sympathetic to the situation
And understand the discrimination.
But fuck it, life's handin' you lemons, make lemonade then!
But if I can't batter the women
How the fuck am I supposed to bake them a cake then?
Don't mistake him for Satan; it's a fatal mistake.
If you think I need to be overseas and take a vacation
To trip a broad, and make her fall on her face and.
Don't be a retard be a king?
Think not
Why be a king when you can be a god?
I am a sinner who's probably gonna sin again
Lord, forgive me!  Lord, forgive me! 
Things I don't understand
Sometimes I need to be alone
Bitch, don't kill my vibe! 
Bitch, don't kill my vibe! I can feel your energy from two planets away. I got my drink, I got my music
I would share it, but today I 'm yelling. Bitch, don't kill my vibe!  Bitch, don't kill my vibe! 
Bitch, don't kill my vibe!  Bitch, don't kill my vibe! Look inside of my soul
And you can find gold and maybe get rich
Look inside of your soul and you can find out it never exist. I can feel the changes
I can feel a new life, I always knew life can be dangerous. I can say that I like a challenge and you tell me it's painless
You don't know what pain is. How can I paint this picture
When the color blind is hangin' with you? Fell on my face and awoke with a scar
Another mistake livin' deep in my heart. Wear it on top of my sleeve in a flick. I can admit that it did look like yours. Why you resent every making of this? Tell me your purpose is petty again
But even a small lighter can burn a bridge
Even a small lighter can burn a bridge. I can feel the changes
I can feel the new people around me just want to be famous. You can see that my city found me
Then put me on stages, to me that's amazin' To you that's a quick check. With all disrespect, let me say thisI

Lord, forgive me!  Lord, forgive me! 
Things I don't understand
Sometimes I need to be alone
Bitch, don't kill my vibe!  Bitch, don't kill my vibe! I can feel your energy from two planets away. I got my drink, I got my music
I would share it, but today I 'm yelling. Bitch, don't kill my vibe!  Bitch, don't kill my vibe! 
Bitch, don't kill my vibe!  Bitch, don't kill my vibe! I 'm tryin' to keep it alive
And not compromise the feeling we love
You're tryin' to keep it deprived
And only co-sign what radio does. And I 'm lookin' right past you. We live in a world, we live in a world on two different axles
You live in a world, you livin' behind the mirror
I know what you scared of
The feeling of feeling emotions inferior. This shit is vital, I know you had to
This shit is vital, I know you had to. To die in a pitiful vain, tell me a watch and a chain
I s way more believable, give me a feasible gain
Rather a seasonal name
I 'll let the people know this is somethin' you can blame
On yourselves, you can remain stuck in a box. I 'ma break out and then hide every lock
I 'ma break out and then hide every lock. I can feel the changes
I can feel the new people around me just want to be famous. You can see that my city found me

You ain't heard the Coast like this in a long time. Don't you see that long line? And they waiting on Kendrick like the first and the fifteenth. Threes in the air, I can see you are in sync. Hide your feelings, hide your feelings
Now what you better do. I 'll take your girlfriend and put that pussy on a pedestal. Bitch, don't kill my vibe!  Bitch, don't kill my vibe! Walk out the door and they scream it's alive. My New Year's resolution is to stop all the pollution
Talk too motherfuckin' much, I got my drink, I got my music. I say bitch, don't kill my vibe!  Bitch, don't kill my vibe!

Let it run, Ali. Martin had a dream
Martin had a dream
Kendrick have a dream
Everybody, everybody, everybody
Everybody sit yo' bitch-ass down
And listen to this true mothafuckin' story
Told by Kendrick Lamar on Rosecrans, ya bish.

Smokin' on the finest dope, ay-ay-ay-ah
Drank until I can't no mo', ay-ay-ay-ah
Really I 'm a sober soul
But I 'm with the homies right now
And we ain't askin' for no favors
Rush a nigga quick, then laugh about it later, ay-ay-ay-ah
Really I 'm a peacemaker
But I 'm with the homies right now
And Momma used to say
One day it's gon' burn you out
One day it's gon' burn you out, out
One day it's gon' burn you out
One day it's gon' burn you
But I 'm with the homies right now

Me and my niggas four deep in a white Toyota
A quarter tank of gas, one pistol, and orange soda
Janky stash box when the federales'll roll up
Basketball shorts with the Gonzales Park odor
We on the mission for bad bitches and trouble. I hope the universe love you today
'Cause the energy we bringin' sure to carry away
A flock of positive activists and fill the body with hate
I f it’s necessary;bumpin' Jeezy first album, lookin' distracted
Speakin' language only we know, you think it's an accent. The windows roll down, all I see is a hand pass it
Hotboxin' like George Foreman grillin' the masses
Of the workin' world;we pulled up on a bunch of workin' girls
And asked them what they workin' with
Look at me, I got the blunt in my mouth
Usually I ’m drug-free, but shit, I ’m with the homies
Yeah, nigga, we off a pill and Remy Red
Come through and bust ya head, nigga! Me and the homies. Sag all the way to the liquor store
Where my niggas pour up 4 and get twisted some more. Me and the homies. I ride for my mothafuckin’ niggas. Hop out, do my stuff, then hop back in. Me and the homies. Matter of fact, I hop out that mothafucka
And be like, “Doo! Doo! Doo! Doo! … Doo! Doo! Doo! Doo! Doo! ”I t’s 2:30 and the sun is beamin'
Air conditioner broke and I hear my stomach screamin'Hungry for anything unhealthy
And if nutrition can help me
I ’ll tell you to suck my dick, then I 'll continue eatin'We speedin' on the 405, passin' Westchester
You know, the light-skinned girls in all the little dresses. Good Lord, they knew we weren’t from ‘round there
‘Cause every time we down there
We pullin' out the Boost Mobile SI M cards. Bougie bitches with no extensions
Hood niggas with bad intentions, the perfect combination. Before we sparked a conversation
We seen three niggas in colors we didn’t like
Then started interrogatin'I never was a gangbanger, I mean
I never was stranger to the fonk neither, I really doubt it
Rush a nigga quick and then we laugh about it
That’s ironic,'cause I ’ve never been violent
Until I ’m with the homies
Me and the homies
. Me and the homies
. Me and the homies
Braggin' about the episode we just had. A shot of Hennessey didn’t make me feel that bad. I ’m usually a true firm believer of bad karma
Consequences from evil will make your past haunt ya. We tryna conquer the city with disobedience. Quick to turn it up, even if we ain’t got the CD in. But Jeezy still playin'
And our attitude is still “nigga, what is you sayin'? ”Pull in front of the house
That we been campin' out for like two months
The sun is goin' down as we take whatever we want



Aye, aye, nigga, jackpot, nigga, pop the safe! 
Aye, nigga, I think it's somebody in this room! 
Wait, what? ! 
Nigga, it's somebody in this room! I hit the back window in search of any Nintendo
DVD's, plasma-screen TV's in the trunk. We made a right, then made a left, then made a right
Then made a left, we was just circlin' life. My mama called: . Hello? What you doin'?  — . Kickin' it.
I shoulda told her I ’m probably ‘bout to catch my first offense
With the homies. But – they made a right, they made a left
Then made a right, then another right
One lucky night with the homies. K. Dot, you faded, hood? 
Yeah, we finally got that nigga faded
I think he hit the wrong blunt though
Ooh, which one? 
Well, which one he talkin' about? 
I was finna hit the one with the shenanigans in it
I pray he ain't hit that
Nah, that nigga straight, he ain't hit that one
Got the shenanigans? Give that nigga the shenanigans! What that nigga— what's that Jeezy song say, nigga? 
. Last time I checked I was the man on these streets! 
Yeah, yeah, that shit right there
I 'm tryna be the nigga in the street. There he go. Man, you don't even know how the shit go
Look, here's the plan, luv
We gon' use the kickback as a alibi, wait'til the sun go down, roll out, complete the mission, drop K. Dot off at his mama van, at the park'Cause I know he tryna fuck on Sherane tonight. That's what he’s not gon' do
Then we all gon' meet back at the block at about 10:30
That's straight, but we should meet up around 12
I 'm tryna fuck on somethin' too
Nigga, sit yo' dumb-ass back down! 
Nigga, you ain't doin' shit tonight! 
Matter of fact, nigga, get in the mothafuckin' car! 
We finna get active!

Baby lion goes
Where the islands go.

You say you never saw this comin', well you're not alone. Million dollar renovations to a happy home. My ex says she gave me the best years of her life
I saw a recent picture of her, I guess she was right. I wake up, assessin' the damages
Checkin' Media. Take. Out
Pictures of me drunk walkin' out with a bitch
But it's blurry enough to get the fake out. I wake up, all veggies no eggs
I hit the gym, all chest no legs
Yep, then I made myself a smoothie
Yeah, then me and wifey make a movie. Chicago - St. Louis, St. Louis to Chicago
Ándale ándale E.I , E.I , uh-oh. You had me drivin' far enough to switch the time zone
You was the best of all time at the time though
Yeah, you wasn't mine though.

But I still drove 30 hours
And I , I still drove 30 hours to you.

I remember rappin' for Jay and Cam
Young producer just trying to get his flows off. I remember being nervous to do Victoria's Secret
'Til I pictured everybody with they clothes off. Expedition was Eddie Bauer edition. I 'm drivin' with no winter tires in December
Skrrt skrrt skrrt like a private school for women. Then I get there and all the Popeye's is finished, girl
You don't love me, you just pretendin'
I need a happy beginnin', middle and endin'Chicago, St. Louis, St. Louis to Chicago
I t's gettin' hot in here, that's all that I know. Got a hotel room, 3 stars for you
You call down for an omelet
Girl it's 5 in the morning
You realize we at the Double. Tree, not the Aria. Only thing open is Waffle House, girl don't start with me. I used the Western Union for you like it's no prob
'Cause you was in college complainin' about it's no jobs
But you were suckin' a nigga dick the whole time
Well I guess a blowjob's better than no job.

And I drove back 30 hours.

Were remains that long to lose sad
Better unsaid

Back in the lab and shit.

My wife said, I can't say no to nobody
And at this rate we gon' both die broke. Got friends that ask me for money knowin' I 'm in debt
And like my wife said, I still didn't say no. People tryna say I 'm goin' crazy on Twitter. My friends' best advice was to stay low. I guess it's hard to decipher all of the bills
Especially when you got family members on payroll. The media said it was outlandish spendin'
The media said he's way out of control. I just feel like I 'm the only one not pretendin'I 'm not out of control, I 'm just not in they control. I know I 'm the most influential
That TI ME cover was just confirmation. This generation's closest thing to Einstein. So don't worry about me, I 'm fine
I can see a thousand years from now in real life
Skate on the paradigm and shift it when I feel like. Troll conventional thought, don't need to question
I know it's antiquated so sometimes I get aggressive. Thank God for Jay Electra, he down with the mission
Did it with no permission, on our own conditions. Most blacks with money have been beaten to submission
Yeezy with the big house, did it way different
Never listen to Hollywood producers. Don't stare at money too long, it's Medusa. The ultimate Gemini has survived
I wasn't supposed to make it past 25

And you're lookin' at the church in the night sky
Wonderin' whether God's gonna say hi
Oh, you're lookin' at the church in the night sky
And you wonder where is God in your nightlife
Yeah, you're lookin' at the church in the night sky. Wonderin' whether God's gonna say hi. The night sky, yeah, I feel like I 'm home, yeah.

I've been wakin' the spirits of millions more to come. A million illegally downloaded my truth over the drums. I believe in the children, listen to the kids, bro
I f the phone ringin', go and get your kids ho. Brother Don Muhammad told the minister about the presentation
He sat back and smiled. Black on black lies is worse than black on black crime. The Jews share their truth on how to make a dime. Most black men couldn't balance a checkbook
But buy a new car, talkin''bout how my neck look? . Well... it all looks great
Four hundred years later, we buyin' our own chains. The light is before us brothers, so the devil workin' hard. Real family stick together and see through the mirage
The smokescreens, perceptions of false reality. Who the real owner if your boss gets a salary? I am one with the people
I am one with the people I 've been woken from enlightened man's dream. Checkin' I nstagram comments to crowdsource my self esteem. Let me not say too much or do too much
Cause if I 'm up way too much, I 'm out of touch. I 'm prayin' a out-of-body experience will happen. So the people can see my light, now it's not just rappin'
God, I have humbled myself before the court
Drop my ego and confidence was my last resort. I know, I know he got a plan, I know I 'm on your beams
One set of footsteps, you was carryin' me
When I turned on the news and they was buryin' me
One set of footsteps, you was carryin' me. When I was negotiatin' with Apple, it was Larry and me
Told Tim Cook to call me, I was scary to see. I would've took a hundred million and gave 20 to Hov
I heard it's the way they did it when we only had a stove. But it's better that I stayed at home with my folks
Cause if Jay a billionaire then I 'ma never go broke. Only thing I ask is next time I 'm on stage we all go
We all go
Not just by myself, lookin' for niggas like where's Waldo. She got the same shoes as my wife but she copped'em at Aldo. Modern day MJ with a off the wall flow.

My life, walk all over me
Walk all over me
I 'm deliverin' everything I 've ever sent to you, bring. Fly, fly, fly overseas
Fly overseas.

Yeah, you're lookin' at the church in the night sky
Wonderin' whether God's gonna say hi. Oh, you're lookin' at the church in the night sky
And you wonder where is God in your nightlife
Yeah, you're lookin' at the church in the night sky
Wonderin' whether God's gonna say hi
. Oh, you're lookin' at the church in the night sky
And you wonder where is God in your nightlife.

Please face me when I speak
Please say to me somethin' before you leave
You've been treatin' me like I 'm invisible
Now I 'm visible to you
Oh the invisible truths they sold
I can't quite understand the games you play. Understand, understand
Understand I 'm standin' under oath
And I promised I , I wouldn't fall anymore
But I 'm cryin' at the bar
I'm wishin' that you saw my scars, man
I'm wishin' that you came down here
And stood by me
And look at me like you knew me
But I feel so alone
Like I don't know anyone except the night sky above.

Yeah, you're lookin' at the church in the night sky
Wonderin' whether God's gonna say hi
Oh, you're lookin' at the church in the night sky
And you wonder where is God in your nightlife
Yeah, you're lookin' at the church in the night sky.
Wonderin' whether God's gonna say hi
Oh, you're lookin' at the church in the night sky
And you wonder where is God in your nightlife

I'm friends with the monster that's under my bed.
Get along with the voices inside of my head.
You're tryin' to save me, stop holdin' your breath
And you think I 'm crazy, yeah, you think I 'm crazy

I wanted the fame but not the cover of Newsweek
Oh well, guess beggars can't be choosey.
Wanted to receive attention for my music.
Wanted to be left alone in public, excuse me.
For wantin' my cake, and eat it too, and wantin' it both ways.
Fame made me a balloon ‘cause my ego inflated
When I blew, see, but it was confusing‘Cause all I wanted to do's be the Bruce Lee of loose leaf.
Abused ink, used it as a tool when I blew steam
Ooh! Hit the lottery, ooh-wee!
But with what I gave up to get it was bittersweet.
It was like winnin' a used mink.
Ironic ‘cause I think I 'm gettin' so huge
I need a shrink. I 'm beginnin' to lose sleep: one sheep, two sheep.
Going coo-coo and kooky as Kool Keith.
But I 'm actually weirder than you think, ‘cause I'm

I'm friends with the monster that's under my bed.
Get along with the voices inside of my head.
You're tryin' to save me, stop holdin' your breath
And you think I 'm crazy, yeah, you think I'm crazy.
Well, that’s nothin'
Well, that’s nothin'

Now, I ain't much of a poet
But I know somebody once told me to seize the moment
And don't squander it
‘Cause you never know when it all could be over tomorrow
So I keep conjurin'
Sometimes I wonder where these thoughts spawn from.
Yeah, ponderin' will do you wonders
No wonder you're losing your mind, the way it wanders.
Yodel-odel-ay-hee-hoo!
I think it went wanderin' off down yonder
And stumbled onto Jeff VanVonderen
‘Cause I need an interventionist
To intervene between me and this monster
And save me from myself and all this conflict
‘Cause the very thing that I love's killing me
And I can't conquer it
My OCD is conkin' me in the head, keep knockin'
Nobody's home, I'm sleepwalkin'
I 'm just relayin' what the voice in my head's sayin'
Don't shoot the messenger, I 'm just friends with the

I'm friends with the monster that's under my bed.
Get along with the voices inside of my head.
You're tryin' to save me, stop holdin' your breath
And you think I 'm crazy, yeah, you think I'm crazy.
Well, that’s nothin'
Well, that’s nothin'
Call me crazy, but I have this vision
One day that I'll walk amongst you a regular civilian.
But until then, drums get killed and
I'm comin' straight at MC's, blood gets spilled and.
I'll take it back to the days that I'd get on a Dre track
Give every kid who got played that pumped-up feelin'
And shit to say back to the kids who played him.
I ain't here to save the fuckin' children
But if one kid out of a hundred million
Who are going through a struggle feels it
And relates, that's great, it's payback, Russell Wilson
Falling way back in the draft
Turn nothin' into somethin', still can
Make that, straw into gold chump, I will spin
Rumpelstiltskin in a haystack.
Maybe I need a straight jacket, face facts
I am nuts for real, but I 'm okay with that.
I's nothin', I 'm still friends with the

I'm friends with the monster that's under my bed.
Get along with the voices inside of my head.
You're tryin' to save me, stop holdin' your breath
And you think I 'm crazy, yeah, you think I'm crazy.
I'm friends with the monster that's under my bed.
Get along with the voices inside of my head.
You're tryin' to save me, stop holdin' your breath
And you think I 'm crazy, yeah, you think I 'm crazy.
Well, that’s nothin'
Well, that’s nothin'

Head up high, I look to the light
Hey,'cause I know that you'll make everything alright
And I know that you'll take good care of your child
Oh, no longer am afraid of the night
'Cause I, I look to the light

When they come for you, I will shield your name
I will field their questions, I will feel your pain
No one can judge

Glory be to God, yeah
I'ma make sure that they go where they can't go
If they don't wanna ride I'ma still give them raincoats
Know what God said when he made the first rainbow
Just throw this at the end if I'm too late for the intro
Ugh, I'm just having fun with it
You know that a nigga was lost
I laugh in my head
'Cause I bet that my ex looking back like a pillar of salt

This prayer's for everybody that feels like they're too messed up
For everyone that feels they've said

What if we fuck right now? 
What if we fucked right in the middle
Of this mothafuckin' dinner table? 
What if we fucked at this Vogue party? 
Would we be the life of the whole party? 
Shut down the whole party
Would everybody start fuckin'? 
Would everybody start fuckin'? 
Would everybody start fuckin'? 
They don't want nothin'
You mothafuckas livin' like half of your level, half of your life

Waves don't die
Let me crash here for the moment
I don't need to own it
No lie
Waves don't die, baby
Let me crash here for a moment
Baby I don't, I don't need to own...

Sun don't shine in the shade 
Bird can't fly in a cage  
Even when somebody go away 
The feelings don't really go away
That's just the wave 

Waves don't die
Let me crash here for the moment
I don't need to own it
No lie
Waves don't die, baby
Let me crash here for a moment
Baby I don't, I don't need to own you

No lie

No lie
Ooh baby, ooh baby
You set the night on fire
I'm still gon' be here in the morning
No lie
I been waiting for a minute
For my lady
So I can't jeopardize that for one of these hoes
I been living without limits
As far as my business
I'm the only one that's in control
I been feeling all I've given
For my children
I will die for those I love
God, I'm willing
To make this my mission
Give up the women
Before I lose half of what I own
I been thinking
About my vision
Pour out my feelings
Revealing the layers to my soul
My soul
The layers to my soul
Revealing the layers to my soul

They wish I would go ahead and fuck my life up
Can't let them get to me
And even though I always fuck my life up
Only I can mention me

See, before I let you go
One last thing I need to let you know
You ain't never seen nothing crazier than
This nigga when he off his Lexapro
Remember that last time in Mexico? 
Remember that last time, the episode? 
Asking me why the hell I text in code? 
Four times just to say, 
Don't text me, hoe
Told you four times, 
Don't test me, hoe
And we finna lose all self-control
But you ain't finna be raising your voice at me
Especially when we in the Giuseppe store
But I'mma have the last laugh in the end
'Cause I'm from a tribe called check a hoe
Yeah, I'mma have to laugh Indian
'Cause I'm from a tribe called check a hoe
And I...

They wish I would go ahead and fuck my life up
Can't let them get to me
And even though I always fuck my life up
Only I can mention me
They wish I would go ahead and fuck my life up
Can't let them get to me
And even though I always fuck my life up
Only I can mention me

See through the veil
And forget all of your cares
Throw them
Throw them away
Don't stop your loving
Don't stop for nothing
No, not for nothing
They don't wanna see me love you
Don't now, don't stop it
They always love it
They always wanna
They don't wanna see me love you
See through the veil
They don't wanna see me love you
And forget all your cares
They don't wanna see me love you
Throw them
Throw them away
Ooh, life's a feeling and
Ooh, the body is a feeling
Real friends, how many of us? 
How many of us, how many jealous? Real friends
I's not many of us, we smile at each other
But how many honest? Trust issues
Switched up the number, I can't be bothered
I cannot blame you for havin' an angle
I ain't got no issues, I'm just doin' my thing
Hope you're doin' your thing too
I'm a deadbeat cousin, I hate family reunions
Fuck the church up by drinkin' at the communion
Spillin' free wine, now my tux is ruined
In town for a day, what the fuck we doin'? 
Who your real friends? We all came from the bottom
I'm always blamin' you, but what's sad, you not the problem
Damn I forgot to call her, shit I thought it was Thursday
Why you wait a week to call my phone in the first place? 
When was the last time I remembered a birthday? 
When was the last time I wasn't in a hurry? 

Tell me you want your tickets when it's gametime
Even to call your daughter on her Face
Time
Even when we was young I used to make time
Now we be way too busy just to make time
Even for my...

Real friends
I guess I get what I deserve, don't I? 
Word on the streets is they ain't heard from him
I guess I get what I deserve, don't I? 
Talked down on my name, throwed dirt on him

I couldn't tell you how old your daughter was
Couldn't tell you how old your son is
I got my own Jr. on the way, dawg
Plus I already got one kid
Couldn't tell you much about the fam though
I just showed up for the yams though
Maybe 15 minutes, took some pictures with your sister
Merry Christmas, then I'm finished, then it's back to business
You wanna ask some questions'bout some real shit? 
Like I ain't got enough pressure to deal with
Please don't pressure me with that bill shit
Cause everybody got'em, that ain't children
Oh you've been nothin' but a friend to me
Niggas thinkin' I'm crazy, you defendin' me
I's funny I ain't spoke to niggas in centuries
To be honest, dawg, I ain't feelin' your energy
Money turn your kin into an enemy
Niggas ain't real as they pretend to be

Lookin' for all my real friends
How many of us? How many of us are real friends
To real friends,'til the reel end
'Til the wheels fall off,'til the wheels don't spin
To 3 A.M., callin'
How many real friends? 
Just to ask you a question
Just to see how you was feelin'
How many? 
For the last you was frontin'
I hate when a nigga text you like, 
What's up, fam? Hope you good
You say, 
I'm good, I'm great,  the next text they ask you for somethin'
How many? 
What's best for your family, immediate or extended
Any argument, the media'll extend it
I had a cousin that stole my laptop that I was fuckin' bitches on
Paid that nigga 250 thousand just to get it from him
Real friends
Huh? 

Real friends
I guess I get what I deserve, don't I
Word on the streets is they ain't heard from him
I guess I get what I deserve, don't I
Talked down on my name, throwed dirt on him

Turned out, burned up
You found me, through a heartache
Didn't know me, you were drawn in

You found me, in your gaze
I found you, oh Jesus
I was too wild, I was too wild
I was too wild, I was too wild
I was too wild, I was too wild

And I need you now
Lost and found out

You gotta let me know if I could be your Joseph
Only tell you real shit, that's the tea, no sip
Don't trip, don't trip, that pussy slippery, no whip
We ain't trippin' on shit, we just sippin' on this
Just forget the whole shit, we could laugh about nothin'

I know it's corny niggas you wish you could unswallow
I know it's corny bitches you wish you could unfollow
I know it's corny niggas you wish you could unswallow
You tried to play nice, everybody just took advantage
You left your fridge open, somebody just took a sandwich
I said baby what if you was clubbin'
Thuggin', hustlin' before you met your husband? 
Then I said, 
What if Mary was in the club
'Fore she met Joseph around hella thugs? 
Cover Nori in lambs' wool
We surrounded by the fuckin' wolves
 
What if Mary
 was in the club
'Fore she met Joseph with no love? 
Cover Saint in lambs' wool
 We surrounded by
 the fuckin' wolves​​​

Of cheating, stealing, never feeling
Pain of a brother, your dirty mother

Lord God, I come to you a sinner
And I humbly repent for my sins
I believe that Jesus is Lord
I believe that you raised him from the dead
I will ask that Jesus will come to my life
And be my Lord and Savior
I receive Jesus to take control of my life
And that I may live for him from this day forth
Thank you, Lord Jesus, for saving me with your precious blood
In Jesus' name, Amen

I met her at this house party on El Segundo and Central
She had the credentials of strippers in Atlanta
Ass came with a hump, from the jump she was a camel
I want to ride like Arabians, push an'04 Mercedes-Benz

Hello, my name is Kendrick,  she said 
No, you're handsome.
Whispered in my ear, disappeared, then found her dancin'
Ciara had played in the background
The parade music we made had us all wearin' shades now

Cool, where you stay? 
She said: 
Down the street from Dominguez High
Okay, I know that's borderline Compton or Paramount

Well, is it Compton?  – 
No,  she replied
And quickly start battin' her eyes
And strictly had wanted her thighs around me
Seventeen, with nothin' but pussy stuck on my mental
My motive was rather sinful

What you tryin' to get into? 
She didn't tell, just gave me her Nextel
Dropped the number, we chirped the whole summer, and well

The summer had passed, and now I'm likin' her
Conversation we havin' probably enticin' her
Who could imagine? Maybe my actions will end up wifin' her
Love or lust, regardless we'll fuck,'cause the trife in us
I's deep-rooted, the music of bein' young and dumb
Is never muted; in fact, it's much louder where I'm from
We know a lot'bout each other, her mother was a crack addict
She live with her granny and her younger two brothers
Her favorite cousin Demetrius's irrepetible
Family history of gang bangin' did make me skeptical
But not enough to stop me from gettin' a nut
I wanna come over, what's up? 
That's what I told her soon as this episode
Of Martin go off, I'm tryin' to get off
I was in heat like a cactus, my tactics of bein' thirsty
Probably could hurt me, but fuck it, I got some heart
Grab my momma's keys, hopped in the car, then oh boy

So now I'm down Rosecrans in a Caravan
Passin' Alameda, my gas meter in need of a pump
I got enough to get me through the traffic jam
At least I hope'cause my pockets broke as a promise, man
I'm thinkin' about that sex, thinkin' about her thighs
Or maybe kissin' on her neck, or maybe what position's next
Sent a picture of her titties blowin' up my texts
I looked at'em and almost ran my front bumper into Corvette
Enthused by the touch of a woman, she's a masseuse
And I'm a professional porn star when off the Goose
I had a fifth in the trunk like Curtis Jackson for ransom
I'm hopin' to get her loose like an Uncle Luke Anthem
I'm two blocks away, 250 feet
And six steps from where she stay, she wavin' me'cross the street
I pulled up, a smile on my face, and then I see
Two niggas, two black hoodies, I froze as my phone rang

Please leave your message for 323-
Record your message after the tone
Kendrick, where you at? 
Damn! I'm sittin' here waitin' on my van
You told me you was gon' be back in fiffteen minutes! 
I gotta go to the county buildin, man
These kids ready to eat! I’m ready to eat, shit
I gotta get them food stamps, come on now
You on you way or what? 
I hope you ain’t out there messin' with them damn hood-rats out there, shit, especially that crazy-ass girl Sherane
Plus you got school tomorrow
You keep fuckin' around in them streets, you ain’t gon' pass to the next grade, 11th grade

Yo' daddy hollerin' about some damn dominoes
He want to holler at you too
Go'head, Kenny, go! Shit

Kenny!  You on his voicemail! Damn fool  Shit! 

Kenny, give me the damn phone, shit. Don’t hang up! Damn! 

Just let me— Kendrick
When you get this message, man, call me back
I need to know when you gon' bring back my damn car
This man fussin' about some damn dominoes
It ain’t all that serious, fuck, damn dominoes
Shit, I'ma miss my damn appointment! Fuck! 
Fuck them damn dominoes, nobody wanna hear that

Me and my niggas tryna get it, ya bish
Hit the house lick: tell me, is you wit' it, ya bish?
Home invasion was persuasive
From nine to five I know it's vacant, ya bish
Dreams of livin' life like rappers do
Back when condom wrappers wasn't cool
I fucked Sherane and went to tell my bros
Then Usher Raymond "Let It Burn" came on
Hot sauce all in our Top Ramen, ya bish
Park the car, then we start rhymin', ya bish
The only thing we had to free our mind
Then freeze that verse when we see dollar signs
You lookin' like a easy come-up, ya bish
A silver spoon I know you come from, ya bish
And that's a lifestyle that we never knew
Go at a reverend for the revenue


It go Halle Berry or hallelujah
Pick your poison, tell me what you doin'
Everybody gon' respect the shooter
But the one in front of the gun lives forever

And I been hustlin' all day
This-a-way, that-a-way
Through canals and alleyways, just to say
Money trees is the perfect place for shade
And that's just how I feel, nah, nah
A dollar might just fuck your main bitch
That's just how I feel, nah
A dollar might say fuck them niggas that you came with
That's just how I feel, nah, nah
A dollar might just make that lane switch
That's just how I feel, nah
A dollar might turn to a million and we all rich
That's just how I feel


Dreams of livin' life like rappers do
Bump that new E-40 after school
You know, “Big Ballin' With My Homies”
Earl Stevens had us thinkin' rational
Back to reality, we poor, ya bish
Another casualty of war, ya bish
Two bullets in my Uncle Tony head
He said one day I'll be on tour, ya bish
That Louis Burger never be the same
A Louis belt will never ease that pain
But I'ma purchase when that day is jerkin'
Pull off at Church's, with Pirellis skirtin'
Gang signs out the window, ya bish
Hopin' all of 'em offend you, ya bish
They say your hood is a pot of gold
And we gon' crash it when nobody's home


It go Halle Berry or hallelujah
Pick your poison, tell me what you doin'
Everybody gon' respect the shooter
But the one in front of the gun lives forever

And I been hustlin' all day
This-a-way, that-a-way
Through canals and alleyways, just to say
Money trees is the perfect place for shade
And that's just how I feel, nah, nah
A dollar might just fuck your main bitch
That's just how I feel, nah
A dollar might say fuck them niggas that you came with
That's just how I feel, nah, nah
A dollar might just make that lane switch
That's just how I feel, nah
A dollar might turn to a million and we all rich
That's just how I feel


Be the last one out to get this dough? No way!
Love one of you bucket-headed hoes? No way!
Hit the streets, then we break the code? No way!
Hit the brakes when they on patrol? No way!
Be the last one out to get this dough? No way!
Love one of you bucket-headed hoes? No way!
Hit the streets, then we break the code? No way!
Hit the brakes when they on patrol? No way!


Imagine Rock up in them projects
Where them niggas pick your pockets
Santa Claus don't miss them stockings
Liquors spillin', pistols poppin'
Bakin' soda YOLA whippin'
Ain't no turkey on Thanksgivin'
My homeboy just dome'd a nigga
I just hope the Lord forgive him
Pots with cocaine residue
Every day I'm hustlin'
What else is a thug to do
When you eatin' cheese from the government?
Gotta provide for my daughter n'em
Get the fuck up out my way, bish
Got that drum and I got them bands
Just like a parade, bish
Drop that work up in the bushes
Hope them boys don't see my stash
If they do, tell the truth
This the last time you might see my ass
From the gardens where the grass ain't cut
Them serpents lurkin', Blood
Bitches sellin' pussy, niggas sellin' drugs
But it's all good
Broken promises, steal your watch
And tell you what time it is
Take your J's and tell you to kick it where a Foot
Locker is
In the streets with a heater under my Dungarees
Dreams of me gettin' shaded under a money tree


It go Halle Berry or hallelujah
Pick your poison, tell me what you doin'
Everybody gon' respect the shooter
But the one in front of the gun lives forever

And I been hustlin' all day
This-a-way, that-a-way
Through canals and alleyways, just to say
Money trees is the perfect place for shade
And that's just how I feel


K’s Mom: Kendrick, just bring my car back, man. I called in for another appointment. I figured you weren’t gonna be back here on time anyways. Look, shit, shit, I just wanna get out the house, man. This man, on one, he feelin' good as a motherfucker. Shit, I’m tryna get my thing goin', too. Just bring my car back. Shit, he faded. He feelin' good. Look, listen to him!
K’s Dad: Girl, girl, I want your body, I want your body, 'cause of that big ol’ fat ass. Girl, girl, I want your body, I want your body, 'cause of that big ol’ fat ass.
K’s Mom: See, he high as hell. Shit, and he ain’t even trippin' off them damn dominoes anymore. Just bring the car back!
K’s Dad: Did somebody say dominoes?


Every second, every minute
Man, I swear that she can get it
Say if you a bad bitch, put your hands up high
Hands up high, hands up high
Tell 'em dim the lights down right now
Put me in the mood
I'm talkin' about dark room, perfume, go, go


I recognize your fragrance
Hold up, you ain't never gotta say shit
Uh, and I know your taste is
A little bit, hmm, high maintenance
Uh, everybody else basic
You live life on an everyday basis
With poetic justice, poetic justice
If I told you that a flower bloomed in a dark room
Would you trust it?
I mean, I write poems in these songs dedicated to you when
You're in the mood for empathy, there's blood in my pen
Better yet, where your friends and 'em?
I really wanna know you all
I really wanna show you off
Fuck that, pour up plenty of champagne
Cold nights when you curse this name
You called up your girlfriends
And y'all curled in that little bitty Range
I heard that she wanna go and party, she wanna go and party
Nigga, don't approach her with that Atari
Nigga, that ain't good game, homie, sorry
They say conversation rule a nation, I can tell
But I could never right my wrongs
'Less I write it down for real, P.S.


You can get it, you can get it
You can get it, you can get it
And I know just, know just, know just
Know just, know just what you want
Poetic justice, put it in a song, alright
You can get it, you can get it
You can get it, you can get it
And I know just, know just, know just
Know just, know just what you want
Poetic justice, put it in a song, alright


I really hope you play this, 'cause ol' girl, you test my patience
With all these seductive photographs
And all these one-off vacations you've been takin'
Clearly a lot for me to take in, it don't make sense
Young East African girl, you too busy fuckin' with your other man
I was tryna put you on game, put you on a plane
Take you and your momma to the motherland
I could do it, maybe one day
When you figure out you're gonna need someone
When you figure out it's alright here in the city
And you don't run from where we come from
That sound like poetic justice, poetic justice
You were so new to this life, but goddamn, you got adjusted
I mean, I write poems in these songs, dedicated to the fun sex
Your natural hair and your soft skin
And your big ass in that sundress, ooh
Good God, what you doin' that walk for?
When I see that thing move
I just wish we would fight less and we would talk more
They say communication save relations, I can tell
But I can never right my wrongs
Unless I write 'em down for real, P.S.


You can get it, you can get it
You can get it, you can get it
And I know just, know just, know just
Know just, know just what you want
Poetic justice, put it in a song, alright
You can get it, you can get it
You can get it, you can get it
And I know just, know just, know just
Know just, know just what you want
Poetic justice, put it in a song, alright


Every time I write these words they become a taboo
Makin' sure my punctuation curve, every letter here's true
Livin' my life in the margin and that metaphor was proof
I'm talkin' poetic justice, poetic justice
If I told you that a flower bloomed in a dark room
Would you trust it? I mean, you need to hear this
Love is not just a verb, it's you lookin' in the mirror
Love is not just a verb, it's you lookin' for it, maybe
Call me crazy, we can both be insane
A fatal attraction is common, and what we have common is pain
I mean, you need to hear this, love is not just a verb
And I can see power steerin', sex drive when you swerve
I want that interference, it's coherent, I can hear it
Uh-huh, that's your heartbeat
It either caught me or it called me, uh-huh
Read slow and you'll find gold mines in these lines
Sincerely, yours truly, and right before you go blind, P.S.


You can get it, you can get it
You can get it, you can get it
And I know just, know just, know just
Know just, know just what you want
Poetic justice, put it in a song, alright
You can get it, you can get it
You can get it, you can get it
And I know just, know just, know just
Know just, know just what you want
Poetic justice, put it in a song, alright


"I'm gon' ask you one more time, homie
Where is you from? Or it is a problem."
"Ayy, you over here for Sherane, homie?"
"Yo, I don't care who this nigga over here for.
If he don't tell me where he from, it's a wrap! I'm sorry."
"Hol' up, hol' up, hol' up, we gon' do it like this, okay?
I'ma tell you where I'm from, okay?
You gon' tell me where you from, okay?
Or where your grandma stay, where your mama stay, or where your daddy stay, okay?"
"Enough with all this talkin'."
"Matter of fact, get out the van, homie! Get out the car before I snatch you out that motherfucker, homie!"


Mass hallucination, baby
Ill education, baby
Want to reconnect with your elations?
This is your station, baby


Look inside these walls and you see I'm havin' withdrawals
Of a prisoner on his way
Trapped inside your desire to fire bullets that stray
Track attire just tell you I'm tired and ran away
I should ask a choir: "What do you require
To sing a song that acquire me to have faith?"
As the record spin I should pray
For the record, I recognize that I'm easily prey
I got ate alive yesterday
I got animosity buildin', it's prob'ly big as a buildin'
Me jumpin' off of the roof is me just playin' it safe
But what am I 'posed to do when the topic is red or blue
And you understand that I ain't
But know I'm accustomed to just a couple that look for trouble
And live in the street with rank
No better picture to paint than me walkin' from bible study
And called his homies because he had said he noticed my face
From a function that tooken place, they was wonderin' if I bang
Step on my neck and get blood on your Nike checks
I don't mind 'cause one day you'll respect
The good kid, m.A.A.d city


Mass hallucination, baby
Ill education, baby
Want to reconnect with your elations?
This is your station, baby


All I see is strobe lights, blindin' me in my hindsight
Findin' me by myself, promise me you can help
In all honesty I got time to be copacetic until
You had finally made decision to hold me against my will
It was like a head on collision that folded me standing still
I can never pick out the difference and grade a cop on the bill
Every time you clock in the morning, I feel you just want to kill
All my innocence while ignorin' my purpose to persevere
As a better person; I know you heard this and probably in fear
But what am I 'posed to do when the blinkin' of red and blue
Flash from the top of your roof and your dog has to say woof
And you ask: "Lift up your shirt," because you wonder if a tattoo
Of affiliation can make it a pleasure to put me through
Gang files, but that don't matter because the matter is racial profile
I heard 'em chatter: "He's prob'ly young, but I know that he's down
Step on his neck as hard as your bullet-proof vest
He don't mind, he know we'll never respect
The good kid, m.A.A.d. city."


Mass hallucination, baby
Ill education, baby
Want to reconnect with your elations?
This is your station, baby


All I see in this room: 20's, Xannies and these 'shrooms
Grown-up candy for pain, can we live in a sane
Society? It's entirely stressful upon my brain
You hired me as a victim, I quietly hope for change
When violence is the rhythm, inspired me to obtain
The silence in this room with 20's, Xannies and 'shrooms
Some grown-up candy, I lost it, I feel it's nothin' to lose
The streets sure to release the worst side of my best
Don't mind, 'cause now you ever in debt to good kid, m.A.A.d. city


Mass hallucination, baby
Ill education, baby
Want to reconnect with your elations?

Pour up , head shot 
Sit down , stand up 
Pass out , wake up 
Faded , faded 


Now I done grew up 'round some people livin' their life in bottles
Granddaddy had the golden flask
Backstroke every day in Chicago
Some people like the way it feels
Some people wanna kill their sorrows
Some people wanna fit in with the popular, that was my problem
I was in a dark room, loud tunes
Lookin' to make a vow soon
That I'ma get fucked up, fillin' up my cup I see the crowd mood
Changin' by the minute and the record on repeat
Took a sip, then another sip, then somebody said to me


Nigga, why you babysittin' only two or three shots?
I'ma show you how to turn it up a notch
First you get a swimming pool full of liquor, then you dive in it
Pool full of liquor, then you dive in it
I wave a few bottles, then I watch 'em all flock
All the girls wanna play Baywatch
I got a swimming pool full of liquor and they dive in it
Pool full of liquor, I'ma dive in it


Pour up , head shot 
Sit down , stand up 
Pass out , wake up 
Faded , faded 


Okay, now open your mind up and listen me, Kendrick
I am your conscience
If you do not hear me, then you will be history, Kendrick
I know that you're nauseous right now
And I'm hopin' to lead you to victory, Kendrick
If I take another one down
I'ma drown in some poison, abusin' my limit
I think that I'm feelin' the vibe, I see the love in her eyes
I see the feelin', the freedom is granted
As soon as the damage of vodka arrived
This how you capitalize, this is parental advice
Then apparently I'm over-influenced by what you are doin'
I thought I was doin' the most 'til someone said to me


Nigga, why you babysittin' only two or three shots?
I'ma show you how to turn it up a notch
First you get a swimming pool full of liquor, then you dive in it
Pool full of liquor, then you dive in it
I wave a few bottles, then I watch 'em all flock
All the girls wanna play Baywatch
I got a swimming pool full of liquor and they dive in it
Pool full of liquor, I'ma dive in it


Pour up , head shot 
Sit down , stand up 
Pass out , wake up 
Faded , faded 


I ride, you ride, bang
One chopper, one hundred shots, bang
Hop out, do you bang?
Two chopper, two hundred shots, bang
I ride, you ride, bang
One chopper, one hundred shots, bang
Hop out, do you bang?
Two chopper, two hundred shots, bang


Nigga, why you babysittin' only two or three shots?
I'ma show you how to turn it up a notch
First you get a swimming pool full of liquor, then you dive in it
Pool full of liquor, then you dive in it
I wave a few bottles, then I watch 'em all flock

Aw man… where is she takin' me?
Where is she takin' me?


All I have in life is my new appetite for failure
And I got hunger pain that grow insane
Tell me, do that sound familiar?
If it do, then you're like me
Makin' excuse that your relief
Is in the bottom of the bottle and the greenest indo leaf
As the window open I release
Everything that corrode inside of me
I see you jokin', why you laugh?
Don't you feel bad? I probably sleep
And never ever wake up
Never ever wake up, never ever wake up
In God I trust, but just when I thought I had enough


They stomped the homie out over a bitch?
K-dot, you good, blood?
Now we can drop, ye we can drop you back off
That nigga's straight, man, that nigga ain't trippin'
We gon' do the same ol' shit
I'ma pop a few shots, they gon' run, they gon' run opposite ways
Fall right in ----'s lap
And he gon' tear they ass up, simple as that
And I hope that bitch that set him up out there
We gon' pop that bitch too
Wait hold up, ayy, I see somebody
{Car door opens and gunshots are fired}
Aha! Got them niggas, K-dot, you good?
L----, you good?
Yeah, blood, I'm good – Dave, you good?
Dave? Dave, say somethin' – Dave?
These bitch-ass niggas killed my brother!Part I — "Sing About Me"




When the lights shut off and it's my turn
To settle down, my main concern
Promise that you will sing about me
Promise that you will sing about me
I said when the lights shut off and it's my turn
To settle down, my main concern
Promise that you will sing about me
Promise that you will sing about me


I woke up this morning and figured I'd call you
In case I'm not here tomorrow
I'm hopin' that I can borrow
A peace of mind, I'm behind on what's really important
My mind is really distorted
I find nothing but trouble in my life
I'm fortunate you believe in a dream
This orphanage we call a ghetto is quite a routine
And last night was just another distraction
Or a reaction of what we consider madness
I know exactly what happened
You ran outside when you heard my brother cry for help
Held him like a newborn baby and made him feel
Like everything was alright, and a fight he tried to put up
But the type of bullet that stuck had went against his will
As blood spilled on your hands, my plans rather vindictive
Everybody's a victim in my eyes
When I ride, it's a murderous rhythm
And outside became pitch black
A demon glued to my back, whispering "Get 'em"
I got 'em, and I ain't give a fuck
That same mentality that told my brother not to duck
In actuality it's a trip how we trip off of colors
I wonder if I'll ever discover a passion like you and recover
The life that I knew as a youngin
In pajamas and dun-ta-duns
When thunder comes it rains cats and dogs
Dumb niggas like me never prosper
Prognosis of a problem child, I'm proud and well-devoted
This Piru shit been in me forever
So forever I'ma push it, wherever, whenever
And I love you 'cause you love my brother like you did
Just promise me you'll tell this story when you make it big
And if I die before your album drop, I hope— {gunshots}


Promise that you will sing about me
Promise that you will sing about me
I said when the lights shut off and it's my turn
To settle down, my main concern
Promise that you will sing about me
Promise that you will sing about me


You wrote a song about my sister on your tape
And called it Section.80
The message resembled "Brenda's Got a Baby"
What's crazy was I was hearin' about it
But doubted your ignorance
How could you ever just put her on blast and shit?
Judgin' her past and shit?
Well, it's completely my future
Her nigga behind me right now askin' for ass and shit
And I'ma need that forty dollars
Even if I got to fuck, suck, and swallow
In the parking lot, Gonzales Park, I'm followed
By a married man, and father of three
My titties bounce on the cadence of his tinklin' keys
Matter of fact, he my favorite 'cause he tip me with E's
He got a cousin named David and I seen him last week
This is the life of another girl damaged by the system
These foster homes, I run away and never do miss 'em
See, my hormones just run away and if I can get 'em
Back to where they used to be, then I'll probably be in the denim
Of a family gene that show women how to be woman
Or better yet, a leader, you need her to learn somethin'
Then you probably need to beat her, that's how I was taught
Three niggas in one room, first time I was tossed
And I'm exhausted, but fuck that "Sorry for your loss" shit
My sister died in vain, but what point are you tryna gain
If you can't fit the pumps I walk in? I'll wait…
Your rebuttal a little too late
And if you have a album date, just make sure I'm not in the song
'Cause I don't need the attention, bring enough of that on my own
And matter fact, did I mention that I physically feel great?
A doctor's approval is a waste of time, I know I'm straight
I'll probably live longer than you and never fade away
I'll never fade away, I'll never fade away, I know my fate
And I'm on the grind for this cake, I'ma get it or die tryin'
I'm eyein' every male gender with intentions of buyin'
You lyin' to these motherfuckers
Talkin' about you can help 'em with my story
You can help me if you sell this pussy for me, nigga
Don't ignore me, nigga, fuck your glory, nigga, you ain't shit!


When the lights shut off and it's my turn
To settle down, my main concern
Promise that you will sing about me
Promise that you will sing about me
I said when the lights shut off and it's my turn
To settle down, my main concern
Promise that you will sing about me
Promise that you will sing about me


Sometimes I look in the mirror
And ask myself: Am I really scared of passing away?
If it's today, I hope I hear a
Cry out from Heaven so loud it can water down a demon
With the Holy Ghost 'til it drown in the blood of Jesus
I wrote some raps that made sure that my lifeline reekin'
The scent of a reaper, ensuring that my allegiance
With the other side may come soon
And if I'm doomed
May the womb of my mother be blessed for many moons
I suffer a lot
And every day that glass mirror get tougher to watch
I tie my stomach in knots
And I'm not sure why I'm infatuated with death
My imagination is surely an aggravation of threats
That can come about
’Cause the tongue is mighty powerful
And I can name a list of your favorites that probably vouch
Maybe 'cause I'm a dreamer and sleep is the cousin of death
Really stuck in the schema of wondering when I'ma rest
And you're right, your brother was a brother to me
And your sister's situation was the one that pulled me
In a direction to speak on somethin'
That's realer than the TV screen
By any means, wasn't trying to offend or come between
Her personal life, I was like "It need to be told"
Cursing the life of twenty generations after her soul
Exactly what'd happen if I ain't continue rappin'
Or steady being distracted by money, drugs, and four-fives
I count lives, all on these songs
Look at the weak and cry, pray one day you'll be strong
Fighting for your rights, even when you're wrong
And hope that at least one of you
Sing about me when I'm gone
Am I worth it?
Did I put enough work in?


Promise that you will sing about me
Promise that you will sing about me
I said when the lights shut off and it's my turn
To settle down, my main concern
Promise that you will sing about me
Promise that you will sing about me


Promise that you'll sing about me forever
Promise that you'll sing about me for— ooooh
Promise that you'll sing about me forever
Promise that you'll sing about me for— ooooh
Promise that you'll sing about me forever
Promise that you'll sing about me for— ooooh



"Ay, ay, ay, Where you 'bout to go?"
"Nigga, the homie's brother-- nigga, right here, he gone, my nigga, he gone!"
"Nigga-- they just killed the homie's brother, my nigga. We right here on the block, my nigga."
"Al- alright, nigga-- nigga just come-- alright, alright, just call me back, man, just call me back."
{Hangs up}
"Arghh... Fuck!
So what we gon' do, my niggas? What we gon' do?"
"Bro, we can go back right now, my nigga. Like... nigga, I don't give a fuck, my nigga. We can go back right now"
"Fuck! I'm tired of this shit! I'm tired of fuckin' runnin', I'm tired of this shit! My brother, homie!"Part II — "I'm Dying of Thirst"




Tired of running
Tired of hunting
My own kind, but retiring nothing
Tires are steady screeching, the driver is rubbing
Hands on the wheel, who said we wasn't
Dying of thirst, dying of thirst, dying of thirst?


Dope on the corner
Look at the coroner
Daughter is dead, mother is mourning her
Stray bullets
AK bullets
Resuscitation was waiting patiently, but they couldn't
Bring her back, who got the footage?
Channel 9, cameras is looking
It's hard to channel your energy when you know he crooked
Banana clip, split his banana pudding
I'm like Tre, that's Cuba Gooding
I know I'm good at
Dying of thirst, dying of thirst, dying of thirst


How many sins? I'm running out
How many sins? I lost count
Dreams of ballin' like Spalding
But only shotty bounce
The reaper calling
I'm cottonmouth
Money is power 
Yours is ours 
Lay with a snitch
Die with a coward
Hope we get rich
Hope we can tower
Over the city with vanity with the music louder
The same song, a black flower
I'll show you how to
Dye your thirst, dye your thirst, dye your thirst


What are we doing?
Who are we fooling?
Hell is hot
Fire is proven
To burn for eternity
Return of the student
That never learned how to live righteous, but how to shoot it
Tired of running
Choirs is humming
Tell us to visit
We lie about coming
Now back to business
Loading the guns in
Back of the Buick, your hood is feuding
The beef is bubbling
It's no discussion
Hereditary, all of my cousins
Dying of thirst, dying of thirst, dying of thirst


Too many sins, I'm running out
Somebody send me a well for the drought
See all I know, is taking notes
On taking this life for granted, granted, if he provoke
My best days, I stress days

My best days, I stress days
Say "Fuck the world", my sex slave
Money, pussy, and greed – What's my next crave?
Whatever it is, know it's my next grave
Tired of running, tired of running, tired of tumbling
Tired of running, tired of tumbling – backwards
My momma say "See, a pastor give me a promise
What if today was the rapture and you completely tarnished
The truth will set you free, so to me be completely honest
You dying of thirst, you dying of thirst
So hop in that water, and pray that it works"


Fuck! I’m tired of this shit!
I’m tired of fuckin' runnin', I’m tired of this shit!
That’s my brother, homie!
Young man, come talk to me! Is that what I think that is?
I know that's not what I think that is
Why are you so angry?
See, you young men are dying of thirst
Do you know what that means?
That means you need water, holy water
You need to be baptized, with the spirit of the Lord
Do you want to receive God as your personal savior?
Okay, repeat after me:
"Lord God, I come to You a sinner."

"And I humbly repent for my sins."

"I believe that Jesus is Lord."

"I believe you raised Him from the dead."

"I would ask that Jesus come into my life."

"And to be my Lord and Savior."

"I receive Jesus to take control of my life."

"And that I may live with Him from this day forward."

"Thank you, Lord Jesus
For saving me with Your precious blood."

"In Jesus name, amen."

Alright now, remember this day
The start of a new life – your REAL life
If Pirus and Crips all got along
They'd probably gun me down by the end of this song
Seem like the whole city go against me
Every time I'm in the street, I hear—
YAWK! YAWK! YAWK! YAWK!


"Man down, where you from, nigga?"
"Fuck who you know! Where you from, my nigga?"
"Where your grandma stay, huh, my nigga?"
"This m.A.A.d city I run, my nigga"


Brace yourself, I'll take you on a trip down memory lane
This is not a rap on how I'm slingin' crack or move cocaine
This is cul-de-sac and plenty Cognac and major pain
Not the drill sergeant, but the stress that weighin' on your brain
It was me, L Boog, and Yan Yan, YG Lucky ride down Rosecrans
It got ugly, wavin' yo' hand out the window – check yourself!
Uh, Warriors and Conans, Hope euphoria can slow dance
With society, the driver seat the first one to get killed
Seen a light-skinned nigga with his brains blown out
At the same burger stand where *beep* hang out
Now this is not a tape recorder sayin' that he did it
But ever since that day, I was lookin' at him different
That was back when I was nine, Joey packed the nine
Pakistan on every porch is fine, we adapt to crime
Pack a van with four guns at a time
With the sliding door, fuck is up?
Fuck you shootin' for if you ain't walkin' up, you fuckin' punk?
Pickin' up the fuckin' pump, pickin' off you suckers
Suck a dick or die or sucker punch
A wall of bullets comin' from AK's, AR's, "Ayy, y'all, duck!"
That's what Momma said when we was eatin' the free lunch
Aw man, goddamn, all hell broke loose
You killed my cousin back in '94, fuck yo' truce!
Now crawl your head in that noose
You wind up dead on the news
Ain't no peace treaty, just pieces BG's up to pre-approve
Bodies on top of bodies, IV's on top of IV's
Obviously the coroner between the sheets like the Isleys
When you hop on that trolley, make sure your colors correct
Make sure you're corporate or they'll be callin' your mother collect
They say the governor collect all of our taxes, except
When we in traffic and tragic happens, that shit ain't no threat
You movin' backwards if you suggest that you sleep with a TEC
Go buy a chopper and have a doctor on speed dial, I guess
M.A.A.d city


"Man down, where you from, nigga?"
"Fuck who you know! Where you from, my nigga?"
"Where your grandma stay, huh, my nigga?"
"This m.A.A.d city I run, my nigga"


If Pirus and Crips all got along
They'd probably gun me down by the end of this song
Seem like the whole city go against me
Every time I'm in the street, I hear—
YAWK! YAWK! YAWK!
Wake yo' punk-ass up!
It ain't nothin' but a Compton thang
G-yeah, real simple and plain
Let me teach you some lessons about the street

Hood 
It ain't nothin' but a Compton thang
G-yeah, how we do


Fresh outta school 'cause I was a high school grad
Sleepin' in the living room of my momma's pad
Reality struck, I seen the white car crash
Hit the light pole, two niggas hopped out on foot and dashed
My pops said I needed a job, I thought I believed him
Security guard for a month and ended up leavin'
In fact, I got fired, 'cause I was inspired by all of my friends
To stage a robbery the third Saturday I clocked in
Projects tore up, gang signs get thrown up
Cocaine laced in marijuana
And they wonder why I rarely smoke now
Imagine if your first blunt had you foamin' at the mouth
I was straight tweakin', the next weekend we broke even
I made allegiance that made a promise to see you bleedin'
You know the reasons but still will never know my life
Kendrick a.k.a. "Compton's Human Sacrifice"


G-yeah, cocaine, weed
Niggas been mixin' shit since the '80s, loc
Sherm sticks, butt-nakeds
Dip, make a nigga flip
Cluck heads all up and down the block and shit
One time's crooked and shit
Block a nigga in
Alondra, Rosecrans, Bullis, it's Compton


I'm still in the hood, loc, yeah, that's cool
Shit, the hood took me under, so I follow the rules
But yeah, that's like me, I grew up in the hood where they bang
And niggas that rep colors is doin' the same thang
Pass it to the left so I can smoke on me
A couple drive-by's in the hood lately
Couple of IV's with the fuckin' spray-can
Shots in the crowd, then everybody ran
Crew I'm finna slay, the street life I crave
Shots hit the enemy, hearts turn brave
Mount up, regulators in the whip
Down the boulevard with the pistol grip
Trip, we in the hood still
So, loc, grab a strap 'cause yeah, it's so real
Deal with the outcome, a strap in the hand
And a bird and ten grand's where a mothafucka stand


If I told you I killed a nigga at sixteen, would you believe me?
Or see me to be innocent Kendrick you seen in the street
With a basketball and some Now and Laters to eat?
If I mentioned all of my skeletons, would you jump in the seat?
Would you say my intelligence now is great relief?
And it's safe to say that our next generation maybe can sleep
With dreams of bein' a lawyer or doctor
Instead of boy with a chopper that hold the cul-de-sac hostage
Kill 'em all if they gossip
The Children of the Corn, they vandalizin' the option
Of livin' a lie, drown their body with toxins
Constantly drinkin' and drive
Hit the powder, then watch this flame that arrive in his eye
Listen, coward, the concept is aim and then bang it and slide
Out that bitch with deposit, a price on his head, the tithes
Probably go to the projects, I
Live inside the belly of the rough, Compton, USA
Made Me an Angel on Angel Dust, what!


M.A.A.d city
Compton


Nigga, pass Dot the bottle, damn!
You ain't the one that got fucked up
What you holdin' it for?
Niggas always actin' unsensitive and shit
Nigga, that ain't no word
Nigga, shut up!
Hey, Dot, you good, my nigga?
Don't even trip
Just lay back and drink that


I do what I wanna do
I say what I wanna say
When I feel, and I
Look in the mirror and know I'm there
With my hands in the air
I'm proud to say yeah
I'm real, I'm real, I'm really, really, real
I'm real, I'm real, I'm really, really, real
I'm real, I'm real, I'm really, really, real
I'm real, I'm real, I'm really, really, real


I promise that I know you very well
Your eyes never lie, even if they tell
Sweet lullabies that come with a smell
Of a dozen roses flipping down the green hill
You're living in a world that come with plan B
Cause plan A never relay a guarantee
And plan C never could say just what it was
And your plans only can pan around love
You love him, you love them, you love her
You love so much, you love when love hurts
You love red bottom and gold that say "Queen"
You love hand-bag on the waist of your jean
You love French tip and trip that pay for
You love bank slip that tell you we paid more
You love a good hand whenever the card dealt
But what love got to do with it when you don't love yourself?


I do what I wanna do
I say what I wanna say, when I feel, and I
Look in the mirror and know I'm there
With my hands in the air, I'm proud to say yeah
I'm real, I'm real, I'm really, really, real
I'm real, I'm real, I'm really, really, real
I'm real, I'm real, I'm really, really, real
I'm real, I'm real, 


I promise that I know you very well
Your eyes never lie, even if they fell
Out the sky and your optics turn stale
Where they mold that's green, I can see you fit the bill
Of living in a world that come with plan B
Cause plan A only can make another mistake
And you can't see success coming from plan C
When it all breaks, you'll still say you're lovely
And love them and love when you love her
You love so much, you love when love hurts
You love fast cars and dead presidents old
You love fast women, you love keepin' control
Of everything that you love, you love beef
You love streets, you love running, ducking police
You love your hood, might even love it to death
But what love got to do with it when you don't love yourself?


I do what I wanna do
I say what I wanna say, when I feel, and I
Look in the mirror and know I'm there
With my hands in the air, I'm proud to say yeah
I'm real, I'm real, I'm really, really, real
I'm real, I'm real, I'm really, really, real
I'm real, I'm real, I'm really, really, real
I'm real, I'm real 


The reason why I know you very well
Cause we have the same eyes, can't you tell?
The days I tried to cover up and conceal
My pride, it only made it harder for me to deal
When living in a world that come with plan B
A scapegoat cause plan A don't come free
And plan C just an excuse like "because"
Or the word "but," but what if I got love?
I love them, I love when I love her
I love so much, I love when love hurts
I love first verse ’cause you're the girl I attract
I love second verse ’cause you're the homie that pack
Burner like a stove top, that love cooking from scratch
I love what the both of you have to offer
In fact, I love it so much, I don't love anything else
But what love got to do with it when I don't love myself
To the point I should hate everything I do love?
Should I hate living my life inside the club?
Should I hate her for watching me for that reason?
Should I hate him for telling me that I'm seizin'?
Should I hate them for telling me "ball out"?
Should I hate street credibility I'm talkin' about
Hating all money, power, respect in my will
Or hating the fact none of that shit make me real?


Kenny, I ain't trippin' off them dominoes anymore. Just calling, sorry to hear what happened to your homeboy, but don't learn the hard way like I did, homie. Any nigga can kill a man, that don't make you a real nigga. Real is responsibility. Real is taking care of your motherfucking family. Real is God, nigga


I do what I wanna do
I say what I wanna say, when I feel, and I
Look in the mirror and know I'm there
With my hands in the air, I'm proud to say yeah
I'm real, I'm real, I'm really, really, real
I'm real, I'm real, I'm really, really, real
I'm real, I'm real, I'm really, really, real
I'm real, I'm real 


Alright, that's all I wanted to tell you. Just make sure you call us back when you get this message. Here go your mom


Boy, you better have my car on full all this time you done had my damn car, but look I ain't trippin'. Look, the neighbors say they seen you and your little friends over there by Food for Less and they was preaching to you over there telling you about the good book because right about now that's what ya'll need. Oh, and Top Dawg called the house too. I guess they want you and Dave to come to the studio. But look, you take that music business serious, and put out something me and your dad can step to. Shit, you know we from Chicago, you know that's what we do

"If I don't hear from you by tomorrow, I hope you come back and learn from your mistakes. Come back a man, tell your story to these black and brown kids in Compton. Let 'em know you was just like them, but you still rose from that dark place of violence, becoming a positive person. But when you do make it, give back with your words of encouragement, and that's the best way to give back. To your city... And I love you Kendrick, if I don't hear you knocking on the door you know where I usually leave the key. Alright? Talk to you later, bye."




Now everybody serenade the new faith of Kendrick Lamar
This is King Kendrick Lamar
King Kendrick and I meant it, my point intended is raw
Fix your lenses forensics would've told you Kendrick had killed it
Pretend it's a massacre and the masses upon us
And I mastered being the master at dodging your honor
And the chapter that read at 25 I would live dormant like five in the morning
They raid your spot while Kendrick's performing
And if they take everything, know I got


Compton, Compton, ain't no city quite like mine


Ay, Dre what's happening wit' it my nigga
Still I'm at it, peel the plastic off it, you can feel the magic
Still I'm laughing at the critics talking, I can see 'em gagging
When I'm back in the back of my city, back in the 'bach
With a batch of them banging Dre Beats with me, look where I'm at
It's the murder cap' and I'm captain at birthing this gangsta rap
It's a wrap when I'm done and I come a long way from a hundred dollars a month
To a hundred mil' in a day, bitch I'm from


Compton, Compton, ain't no city quite like mine


So come and visit the tire screeching, ambulance, policeman
Won't you spend a weekend on Rosecrans nigga
Khaki creasing, crime increasing on Rosecrans nigga
Kendrick Conan nigga
Where you sword at, hand on the cross and swore that
I do it big as Rasputia for them shooters
Kama Sutra scream fuck your position and make you hold that
I'm trying to stay grounded like four flats
But I know flats and Piru Crip tats


Will swarm on me like a beehive
Hop in the G ride
From the West to the East side
Know that's just how Compton roll


And that's a given
I pass the blunt then pass the torch of course that's my decision
I crash the Porsche then you report that you see me in Benzes
I must report that we import the narcotics you bought it
Then talked about it when crack hit the speakers, the music business
I blow up every time we throw up a record
Depending on what you expecting, I'm sure it's bigger than your religion
Perfected by niggas that manifested music to live in


Compton, Compton, ain't no city quite like mine


So tell that gangster throw his set high
Roll it up in a blunt, I'mma take you on the next high
I did exactly what I wanted that's what made them checks fly
In my direction, you never questioned when I said I
Would be a mogul before I visit 2Pac and Left-eye
Eazy and Aaliyah when I see you we gon' test drive
A Lambo in heaven but for now I'm on the redeye
Flying back to my city cuz I'll forever standby


Compton, Compton, ain't no city quite like mine


Now we can all celebrate
We can all harvest the rap artists of NWA
America target our rap market, as controversy and hate
Harsh realities we in made our music translate
To the coke dealers, the hood rich
And the broke niggas that play
With them gorillas that know killers
That know where you stay
Roll that kush, crack that case, ten bottles of rosé
This was brought to you by Dre
Now every motherfucker in here say:
"Look who's responsible
For taking Compton international
I make 'em holla"


Ayo Just Blaze, good looking homie
Just Blaze
Ain't no city quite like mine, yeah
In the city of Compton
Ain't no city quite like mine


Mom, I finna use the van real quick!
Be back, 15 minutes!

*sound of airplane wheels hitting the tarmac*


Smokin' weed with you
'Cause you taught me to
Smokin' weed with you

Every morning when I wake up, uh
Money on my mind, good time to get caked up, uh
Sunshine coming through my blinds, I’m living, but
Really though, it's never enough
10 milli on, that's a must, living in California
Everybody wanna visit for women, weed and weather
They come for women, weed and weather
For the women, weed and weather
From all around the world for the women, weed and weather
These niggas'll kill for that, put it in your grill for that
Still everybody gotta build for that, me? I make mills off that
How the fuck y'all can't see I ride, when I drive, down the block and
You look outside, H-A-T-E in your eyes, I enter big money for the enterprise
It's a beautiful day, I guess, for a bitch to roll with Andre, I guess
Roll it up, baby, come and lift that dress then roll it up for me when I'm stressed


You might catch me in Atlanta looking like a boss
New Orleans and then Miami, party in New York

But nothing like my hometown I'm forever living

Three W's only for a three-day run, bitch
Take them mothafuckin' panties off, you ain't no nun, shit
I be living in the sky every time I ride by them hoes
Ribbon in the sky on the radio 'cause Stevie know I control
Let it breathe, I control, California living 'til I am old
You want to be on to peak on the charts
So the peons can be gone and pee on their hearts
She in the coupe, she in the Neon
'Cause she on the BS before we can start
Fuck with a nigga, ride with a nigga
Let 'em know I'm priority, order me
Hennessey and for my niggas
OG Killa, call it Jason Voorhees
Boy he's on his job, boy, he sure be having the marks on they mark
Pretty bitches and tire marks, let 'em inhale them pipe exhausts
Let 'em reveal how much it cost for this life controlling my vice
No way, hell no, uh uh, if I'm wrong I don't wanna be right
We want to be on to peak on the chart
So the peons can be gone and pee on their hearts
Women, weed, weather, it's not my fault
That it's eighty-two degrees and my top peeled off

And I know that I'm in a position of controlling anything, I by that ocean

They want that shit, they often fiend
I give it to 'em, but in between
My time, I gotta tie shoestrings
Life's a trip when you want these things
I often slip and then I lean
Toward three W's in life
You know blow job need an application
Eating pussy make appetite
And yeah my type, I like 'em brown
Just like my drink, the fuck you think?
I don't fuck with no hand me downs
See if you fuck then it's after me
You know how much I'mma make it work?

Some saying, "What up? What up? Nigga, you made it"
Some saying, "What up? What up? Nigga, you made it"
Some saying, "What up? What up? Nigga, you made it"
So I'm saying, "What up? What up? Nigga, I hate it"
So I'm saying, "What up? What up? Nigga, I hate it"
Frustrated and I'm riding down the back streets
Making my conscience ask me
"Would I survive to make it up out this hole in time?"
Black boy fly, black boy fly
Black, black boy fly, black boy fly


I used to be jealous of Arron Afflalo
I used to be jealous of Arron Afflalo
He was the one to follow
He was the only leader foreseeing brighter tomorrows
He would live in the gym, we was living in sorrow
Total envy of him, he made his dream become a reality
Actually making it possible to swim
His way up outta Compton with further more to accomplish
Graduate with honors, a sponsor of basketball scholars
It's 2004 and I'm watching him score thirty
Remember vividly how them victory points had hurt me
'Cause every basket was a reaction or a reminder
That we was just moving backwards
The bungalow where you find us
The art of us ditching classes, heading nowhere fast
Stick my head inside the study hall, he focused on math
Determination ambition, plus dedication and wisdom
Qualities he was given was the shit we didn't have
Dug inside of his book bag and Coach Palmer asked for his finals
He had his back like a spinal, meanwhile
We singing the same old song spinning the vinyl
Eleven graders gone wrong
He focused on the NBA, we focused on some Patron
Now watch that black boy fly


Black boy fly, watch that black boy fly
Black boy fly, watch that black boy fly
Black boy fly, watch that black boy fly
Black boy...


I used to be jealous of Jayceon
I used to be jealous of Jayceon Taylor when I was young
Taylor made a career out of music from writing songs
A Buick had driven past bumping him when I mowed the lawn
Money laundering hustling, homies pondering up against
Schemes to make a million even if doing you harm
War's the case and just in case you wasn't alarmed
The city had fought with firearms and many had died before dawn
It's 2004 and I'm hearing the people roar
For the name of The Game, they line in front of the store
Swap meets, selling our mixtapes, I'm like, "Oh shit, wait"
Don't wanna be another nigga stuck regretting mistakes
Mixed feelings was my opinion, I was defending my insecurities
Chillin' my conscience next to a villain
Compton made you believe success wasn't real
Be honest, none of us knew of a record deal
So as I peel through these lottery tickets
I see a Harley Davidson truck visit the same plaza we shopped
A tall nigga hopped out with Jordans and a white tank top
He was top of the rap game, we was the top of the block
So watch that black boy fly


Black boy fly, watch that black boy fly
Black boy fly, watch that black boy fly
Black boy fly, watch that black boy fly
Black boy...


My mama didn't raise me up to be jealous-hearted
Like most of the winners call it
Regardless of where you stay, hold your head and continue marching
That's what she said, but in my head I wanted to be like Jordan
Award touring the country with money from mic recording
The only way out the ghetto, you know the stereotype
Shooting hoops or live on the stereo like Top 40
And shortly, I got discouraged
Like every time I walked to the corner, had them guns bursting
Nigga, I was rehearsing in repetition the phrase
That only one in a million will ever see better days
Especially when the crime waves was bigger than tsunamis
Break your boogie boards to pieces, you just a typical homy
All these niggas facetious and they all standing beside me
They all'll buy me a chopper if any one of you try me
What am I to do when every neighborhood is an obstacle?
When two niggas making it out had never sounded logical?
Three niggas making it out? That's mission impossible
So I never believed the type of performance that I could do
I wasn't jealous cause of the talents they got
I was terrified they'd be the last black boys to fly out of Compton
Thank God...



We on?
Aight
1,2,3, go!


Waking up in a dream
Sleepwalking on another big stage
You never heard peace 'til you hear people scream
Your name in unison, I'm so far away
From the place I used to be, struggling usually
Look at the newer me, fate pursuing me
I can feel the energy in the air
It feel like I'm supposed to be here


Everywhere I go I'm getting so much love
Fans, the stars, everyone
Sayin how they can't wait for the LP
And I'm gonna blow
They believe in me
Feel so good in what you do
Helps somebody else get through
That's why I do the best I can
Because I know how blessed I am


I'm so high I can touch the sky
I know it's my time
And it's now or never
I shine so bright I light the night
And it feels so right, ain't nothing better


A fool if I take it all for granted
A smart man if I keep my feet planted
To the earth cause the people that hurt can understand it
You speakin' outlandish
I'mma show you how to make it all work
Another planet, a short term goal for me
A record sold for me
It's just more of me in your ear
For you to hear Kendrick persevere
Defenses I feel relentless
Ambition with a clear vision
Takin' off I ain't takin off these Pistons
I'm takin' off on the inner me - you're distance
Came across me, how much it'a cost me
To get you out my business
I said a planet is a short term goal, no sky is the limit
I'm past that, now pass that
Award, not one but four
Times two plus yours


I see myself performing there, 
Sold out shows where the room is packed
Sitting at the Grammy's winning five awards
See myself on big billboards
Traveling around the world with endorsement deals
Can't imagine how it feels
That's why I'm smiling everyday
Because my dream ain't far away


I'm so high I can touch the sky
I know it's my time
And it's now or never
I shine so bright I light the night
And it feels so right, ain't nothing better


You looking at me and you tell me I'm blessed
Calculated my steps, my heart, my breath
Breathe in lungs of a victory and vividly
You see me when at my best, my worst
This verse dedicated to the days that I slept
With a curse research my paid dues I'm reimbursed
I burst in the crowd with a voice and crown
I'm a King on the prowl and I see mama smile?
And I vow on the tape that I'll never break
You can break bread with me now
We can all take a bow on the edge of the pedestal
Then scream out loud that we made it off the avenue
And walked that mile
In the darkness I often sit back
And get lost in the rap that I wrote
When you told me that it spoke to your soul
I was talking to you
I was walking it through every ghetto
Tell success hello
We here


And I'm so happy I cry
Cause I can't believe
All the things I ever wanted
Are finally happening for me
And it's so surreal
That I almost feel
That any minute I can wake up
From this fantasy
When you pray so hard
And you've come so far
And you know that it's the time for you to lift your bar
And I'm gonna do it
Watch me!


I'm so high I can touch the sky
I know it's my time
And it's now or never
I shine so bright I light the night
And it feels so right, ain't nothing better

I'm so high I can touch the sky
I know it's my time
And it's now or never
I shine so bright I light the night
And it feels so right, ain't nothing better


Look at all the bullshit I been through
If I take you home, will you tell the truth
Look at all the bullshit I been through
If I take you home, will you tell the truth


Momma take this mothafuckin' block off
Tryna reach you everyday, collect calls
Never get through, and I go through withdrawals
Say who told you that I wanted this door
To slam shut, I just wanted to vent or
Ask you if you give me your rent for
A attorney, I can pay you back more
Soon as I get out, yea every rack is yours
Commissary running low, I need help
Not too much, I hustle up the rest myself
K Dot wrote me saying Marcus got killed
If you knew me, then you know how bad I feel
Quisha prove me wrong, and never came to visit
And I heard she fucking on some other nigga
And my niggas left me in the dark, blind
Mama just get back at me this last time


Men lie, women lie – men lie, women lie
Men lie, women lie – men lie, women lie
Look at all the bullshit I been through
If I take you home, will you tell the truth


Mama take this mothafuckin' block off
That's on the date the day I take the block off
Pulled up, and they put me in them cop cars
Please believe me, This ain't easy by far
You forgot you're talking to your only son
Remember when you put me in that relay run
I was racing, chasing dreams to be the best
You had taught me that the very day I won
All I need is you to give me same support
Investigation saying that the same report
From a witness just might testify in court
DA say I take a deal, or take a loss
I ain't built for all them god damn numbers
God's will, say a prayer for me mama
If you can't, then open up the phone lines
Mama just get back at me this last time




Dante, if I stress to take the block off
That's the day the state had take them locks off
I could only help but do so much
Bettering yourself, your own crutch
Look at your reflection tell me who you see
Who is your protection, G-O-D
No it's not neglection, I have just accepted
Your fate and what its gon' be
Remember all the nights that I cried
Thinking that my only son just died
Peeking through the window, kicking through the door
It's you they looking for, raid outside
Rather see you locked up than dead
Only you would say that I'm selfish
So before I take the stand, and put this bible in my hand
Son, let me say this

Greeting boys and girls
My name is Petey P
Kendrick's childhood imaginary friend 
I am your neighbor
And I’d like to welcome you to good kid, m.A.A.d city
So grab your cartoons and cereal
Your pop guns and fireworks
And sing along


When we grow up we gon go and get us a million
Spend it all in front of the county building
Blow it like Coltrane, blow it like Coltrane
When we grow up we gon go and get us a million
Spend it all in front of the county building
Blow it like Coltrane, blow it like Coltrane



I’ve been waiting on this day since Dr. Dre and Pac
Was on Rosecrans in that burgerstand at '95
People staring at 'em in amazement
Reservations at the Days Inn
We was living out a hotel at the time
Breakfast, lunch and dinner chicken from Kentucky Fried
Mama babysitting Section 8 vouchers the move
When nothing else to lose but a burger flipping job
Close my eyes inside the swap meet and imagine it's a mansion
Gold ballroom, AK-47 dancing
Howling at the moon, what’s a pack of hungry babies?
Hope you feed us soon, bite your back, you die of rabies
Everyday we pray to eat at the table at Sizzlers
But never make the visit, if better days was on its way
Then they make the decision, to make the wrong turn
So for now we heat this skillet so this canned food can burn



When we grow up we gon go and get us a million
Spend it all in front of the county building
Blow it like Coltrane, blow it like Coltrane
When we grow up we gon go and get us a million
Spend it all in front of the county building
Blow it like Coltrane, blow it like Coltrane


And all the ghetto children in the world say, “that’s my car”
All the ghetto boys say, “that’s my car”
All the ghetto girls say, “that’s my car”
When we grow up, when we grow up
Ghetto children in the world say, “that’s my car”
All the ghetto boys say, “that’s my car”
All the ghetto girls say, “that’s my car”
When we grow up, when we grow up



Couple stolen T.V.'s and a seat belt for my safety
Played the passenger I think it’s five years after eighty
Seven, do the math, ‘92, don’t you be lazy
Looking out the window, notice all the essentials
Of a block party that stop for a second, then it rekindle
Like a flame from a trick candle, everybody got dental
Insurance ‘cause we ‘bout to floss, you get that couch I sent you?
I heard that from a block away, probably had credentials
Of a scholar but, shit, not today, them Dayton Spokes was his to take
Refrigerators, barbecue pits, and Jordan kicks
They did invasions while helicopters recorded it
Hello Mi-Mister Miyagi,  I want them Kenwood woofers
Say that you got me, if not, I’ll dig in your drawer for it
The swap meet was the bulls' eye like Tauruses
Murder was the melody you should know what the chorus is
"Papa, you really telling me we can just get some more of it
If we run out?" He said, "Lil' nigga, today the poor is rich
Don’t tell your mom that you seen a Molotov bomb
If she ask just know you have to lie and son don’t forget
Bitches ain’t shit, hoes ain’t neither
Niggas gon' snitch, watch the company you keeping
And one day you’ll put money in the ghetto when you got it
Rather than having to hustle off these Rodney King riots"



When we grow up we gon go and get us a million
Spend it all in front of the county building
Blow it like Coltrane, blow it like Coltrane
When we grow up we gon go and get us a million
Spend it all in front of the county building
Blow it like Coltrane, blow it like Coltrane
Even better than I was the last time baby
Ooh ooh ooh ooh

I'm good, ooh, yeah, I'm good
Even better than I was the last time baby
Ooh ooh ooh ooh, I'm good

So good...

Even better than I was the last time


Rap just make me anxious, and acid made me crazy
Them squares just made me looser and that wax just made me lazy
And I still make this song, and I'mma make another
If you ever actually hit me, better watch out for my brother
Better bet I'd take that deal, gotta watch out for my mother
Get a watch with all that glitters, come in clutters, different colors
Ben-a-Baller, Benford, butlers, chauffeurs, hit a stain-er, did I stutter?
Did a ton of drugs and did better than all my Alma mater
Motherfucker money dance, hundreds zan, gallon lean
Make a joke 'bout Leno's hair then piggy back on Fallon's spleen
Balancing on sporadicity and fucking pure joy
Nightly searches for a bed and I just came off tour with Troy
But I can't complain, I got some motherfucking bitches
How many lab partners have I fucked since I got suspended?
Mr. Bennett, you done did it, you did it, you did it
You did a good ass job, you did a good ass job
And I'm good


Even better than I was the last time baby
Ooh ooh ooh ooh, I'm good
I'm good, so good...
Even better than I was the last time baby
Ooh ooh ooh ooh
I'm good 
So good...


Work, work, work, work, bang nigga, bang
Twerk, twerk, merge, swerve, dang, pick a lane
Flip a bird; pigeon, plane, it's a word, it's a shame
But God I'm good, swear I couldn’t be better
Kicking dirt on the shirts of the lames
Keep a tab on my exes, keep some "x" on my tongue
Keep my work out in Texas, that's just me flexing my lungs
See them showing they teeth, that's just them flapping they gums
If they bite and I'm snapping, clap clap collapsing they lungs
Call me Chancelor The Rapper, please say "The Rapper"
Magical word , please say 'Kadabra
Replay the replays; Green Bay, the Packers
Cremate your teammates and freebase the ashes
Matches to gas leaks, dusted dusk 'til dawn
It's just us, and trust ya bottom, bitch, my stuff the fucking bomb
I'm the motherfucking fucker, fuck a niggas fucking dumb
This your favorite fucking album, I ain't even fucking done
I'm good! IGH!

My druggy
Love me
When I'm ugly
Hug me
When I'm bummy, scummy
I'm your hubby
Let's get lost, let's get lost


Damn, I'm in so deep, girl
Probably 'cause you're empty
You can't even speak 
Damn, your mouth so minty
Ooh your mama hate me
Daddy wouldn't let you, if he ever met me
If he ever met you
Put that shit behind us
And put this in your sinus
Mine is all up in my gums
Minus all that shit it's lined with
I say oh oh oh ohh
You been scratchin', you been fiendin'
I'mma fix you, I'mma fuck you
I'mma get rid of them demons
It's my


My druggy
When I'm ugly
Hug me
When I'm bummy, scummy
I'm your hubby
Let's get lost, let's get lost


Damn, I need a minute... aight, lehgo
She fell in love, it fell apart... aight, let go
She met her match, I let her match
She lit her match, she let me smoke
Yeah me mad petty, yeah me bogus
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah me know
Yeah she knew too , it made her love it
Her pussy like me, her heart like "fuck it"
So dance for daddy like Gator
Ain't no partners on this trip
And lose yourself in my room
And find yourself in my grip
I'm sayin'


My druggy
When I'm ugly
Hug me
When I'm bummy, scummy
I'm your hubby
Let's get lost, let's get lost


I blessed myself inside your arms one day
Swear to God there I was when the dress
And the silver buttons fade away
Miss Mary Mattress, geriatrics
Fuck me into open caskets, I wanna die with this
I wanna stop seeing my psychiatrist
She said "pill pop, baby girl 'cause I promise you, you tweaked
The empty bottled loneliness, this happiness you seek"
The masochism that you preach
Practice back flips, tragic actress
On a movie with no screen
When the only time he loves me is naked in my dreams


My druggy
When I'm ugly
Hug me
When I'm bummy, scummy
I'm your hubby
Let's get lost, let's get lost
IGH!Intro: Slum Village & 
Ladies loving my music is like some sex shit
Niggas trying to grip up my mic like it's a dick 
Run around the corner to pick up the new shit 
Toss this in the deck so niggas can catch rep


What's good good? And what's good evil?
And what's good, gangstas? And what's good, people?
And why's God's phone die every time that I call on Him?
If his son had a Twitter wonder if I would follow him
Swallow them synonyms like cinnamon Cinnabon
Keep all them sentiments down to a minimum
Studious Gluteus Maxim models is sending him
Pics of they genitalia, tallied up ten of 'em
I slurped too many pain-kills down, I'm off a lot
I got a lot off days, but it ain't often that I'm off the clock
Ya kna wha mean, I got the Chicago Blues
We invented rock before the Stones got through
We just aiming back 'cause the cops shot you
Buck buck bang bang, yelling "Fuck Fox News!"
Booyaka buckle up, mothafuck opps too
Ain't no knuckling up 'em young 'cause it just not cool


Nice to see you Father New Year
Middle finger Uncle Samuel
Shooting death with weighted dice
And hitting stains on birthday candles
I know somebody, somebody loves my ass
'Cause they help me beat my demon's ass


Everybody's somebody's everything
I know you right
Nobody's nothing
That's right
Everybody's somebody's everything
I know you right
Nobody's nothing
That's right
Everybody's somebody's everything
I know you right
Nobody's nothing
That's right


Right? IGH
I used to tell hoes I was dark light or off white
But I'd fight if a nigga said that I talk white
And both my parents was black
But they saw it fit that I talk right
With my drawers hid but
My hard head stayed in the clouds like a lost kite
But gravity had me up in a submission hold
Like I'm dancing with the Devil with two left feet and I'm pigeon toed
In two small point ballet shoes with a missing sole
And two missing toes
But it's love like Cupid kissing a mistletoe


Nice to see you Father New Year
Middle finger Uncle Samuel
Shooting death with weighted dice
And hitting stains on birthday candles
I know somebody, somebody loves my ass
'Cause they help me beat my demons ass


Like Cassius ducking the draft and now the fight is over
The type to love from a distance not the type that told her
Spent three days on the rap, trash it and type it over
With babies on the block under arms like fighting odors
Coppers and quotas
Hold ya head like 2Pac had taught
Obviously they are on a come up
With better chances tobogganing in the fucking summer
Concoctions for the bad days and a condom for the good ones
All odds against us we tryna get lucky
Doper than Lucky
You're ending happy that's only a tugging
Like Satan masturbating shit come hot
But y'all still love me ugh
How father time a deadbeat
Maybe I'm adopted
That'll explain why all of my shit been so timeless, IGH


Everybody's somebody's everything
I know you right
Nobody's nothing
That's right
Everybody's somebody's everything
I know you right
Nobody's nothing
That's right
Everybody's somebody's everything
I know you right
Nobody's nothing
That's right
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah yeah, yeah yeah yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah
Yeah yeah yeah yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah yeah yeah yeah, yeah yeah yeah, yeah, yeah


What's better than tripping is falling in love
What's better than Letterman, Leno, Fallon, and all the above
What's better than popping bottles trying to ball in the club
Is the first caveman pops with his son, ball and a club
What's better than paper is ballin' it up
What's better than followers is actually fallin' in love
What's better than frolicking, follies, fallin' in mud
Rolling in green pastures, wanderin', followin' love
What's better than eating is feeding your fam
What's better than meetings is missing meetings to meet with your fam
What's better than leaning and needing a Xan
Is hitting your zan dreaming a dream could mean leaving the land
What's better than yelling is hollerin' love
What's better than rhymes, nickels, dimes and dollars and dubs
Is dialing up your darling just for callin' her up
It ain't nothing better than fallin' in love
IGH!


I've seen it come back, back, back and forth
You hit the nail right on top of the head
I know you've seen it all before
But when it looks you in the eyes, it ain't nothin' you could say but "that's love"
That's love
That's love
That's love
Say that's love, ooh ooh
That's lo-o-ove
That's love
That's love, that's love, that's love
I LOVE you! 
I LOVE you! 
I LOVE you! 
I LOVE you! 
I LOVE you! 
I LOVE you! 
I LOVE you! 
I LOVE you! 
I LOVE you!
That's love
That's loooo-o-o-ove, that's love
Say that's love, ooh, ooh, that's love
That's love, that's love, that's love, that's love


Na na na, na na na

Introducin' Chance the Ruthless, trip 'shrooms and lucy
Dreams is lucid, loosely based on music, swallow my mucus
Hope your pussy get herpes and yo' ass get lupus
Deuces Douches, deuce deuce I'll shoot ya 
Shoes might boot cha and a suit might suit cha
They be on bullshit but they really don't do shit
They use of allusion could confuse Confucius
Nasty, ashy, cigarette ashing, 'til my voice get raspy
Last week suspended, last night kissed Va$htie
Parleyed with Ashley, always in the hallway
So I never been classy 
Shut up!


Na na na, na na na
Na na na, na na na
Na na na, na na na



Acid, Acid, get it? Acid, melts through plastic, I spit fired
Pad my palette, talkin' paper if this was work, I'd get higher
Pardon my mishaps, burp and get murdered
Fart and get bitch-slapped, like bourbon mixed with Jack
Lickety-split, look it! He slipped on a shell
From peelin' banana splits back, give me my Kit-Kat
Don't break me off shit, batch, fack is you mean bitch?
Zan with that lean bitch, zan with that lean bitch
Zen with that chakra I eat it like Idi Amin
Ya kna wha' mean, hit me back when that mean shit


Na na na, na na na
Na na na, na na na
Na na na, na na na



Introducin', it’s Bronsonlino
With my hair slicked back, I look like Rick Pitino
Three Japanese dykes in my El Camino
Lettin' trees blow, oh
I rep the East Coast
I got a team of hoes like Pat Summitt
I look like Arnold Schwarzenegger in a black hummer

I splash summer like a fast brother, with a number on his back
Ain’t no fumblin', in fact, I'm back, acid in my hat
Shoot, then pass the gat
It's at the bottom of the river in a plastic bag
My new shorty got a gymnastic back
'87 emerald green on a classic jag
She had the cleft palate, I ordered chef’s salad
She had the club foot, with that little arm
I couldn’t help but laugh, she ordered Chicken Parm
I had the full Bulls warm-up with the Pippens on


Suck my motherfucking dick
It's the young Randy Velarde
Queens, baby
Blow me
Mmm, IGH!
Acid Rap!

AK hundred dinero, you ever seen Casino?

Her friends done did the Dino, that's that Chicago lingo
Flamin' hots with cheese, and a Kiwi Mistic
My dick won't even call her, cause she left all that lipstick
Niggas be on dirt, that's why I stay on petty

Who's sneaking in the club? that's that youngster rapper
Un-saran wrap the purple, wrap that blunt under after
Smoke all out the window, cops could eat a dick
If you ain't the hitter, you just might be the lick
Flame on, flame on, I'm your bitch's ringtone
She like when I rap raps, but better when I sing songs
No Drake, but I get my Trey on, killin' in the hood like Trayvon
Shoppin' like I got a coupon, savin' like I got a cape on
Cookin' crack in my apron, dressed like a nigga had 8 proms
Tell shorty I may change and I made it and I napalm
Trippy shit to watch drugs while on the clock
Acid on the face that's a work of art

Throw it back like you tryna hurt somethin'
I'm so def, I ain't ever heard nothin'
My name Herb, take herb, smoke herb 
How 'bout you? No dap, but I'll take a pound or two
No doubt like Gwen Stefani's group
Look, let me put my mouth where you potty, boo 
Them niggas pissed, need potty training
They movement shit, that's a potty train
She ain't left yet, but she probably came
We kicked it then I score, soccer game
She was a phony goalie, I got great aim though, don't insult me
I'll give it to ya straight, this is what she told me
My name Solo cause I'm the one and only
She only got you as a nigga on the side
That's a nigga on the side of a side bitch, homie
Then we got out a Dodge, like them Dukes of Hazzard
Music and tabs of Lucy, take your chance with this rapper

Chance's "Na
Na" ad-lib


Kicked off my shoes, tripped acid in the rain
Wore my jacket as a cape, and my umbrella as a cane
The richest man rocks the snatch-less necklace
Spineless bitches in backless dresses
Wore my feelings on my sleeveless
My weed seedless, my trees leafless
I miss my diagonal grilled cheeses
And back when Mike Jackson was still Jesus
Before I believed in not believing in
Yeah, I inhaled, who believed in me not breathing in
Cigarette stained smile all covered in sin
My big homie died young; just turned older than him
I seen it happen, I seen it happen, I see it always
He still be screaming, I see his demons in empty hallways
I trip to make the fall shorter
Fall quarter was just a tall order
And I'm hungry, I'm just not that thirsty
As of late, all my verses seem not so verse-y
And all my words just mean controversy
Took the team up off my back, like "That's not your jersey?"
Stressin', pullin' my hair out, hoping I don't get picked
All this medicine in me hoping I don't get sick
Making all of this money hoping I don't get rich
Cause niggas still getting bodied for foams
Sometimes the truth don't rhyme
Sometime the lies get millions of views
Funerals for little girls, is that appealing to you?
From your cubicle desktop, what a beautiful view
I think love is beautiful too
Building forts from broken dams, what a hoover could do
For future hoopers dead from Rugers
Shooting through the empty alley
Could've threw him an alley-oop
Helping him do good in school
Damn that acid burn when it clean ya
I still miss being a senior
And performing at all those open mic events
Eyes closed, eyes closed seeing arenas
And I still get jealous of Vic
And Vic's still jealous of me
But if you touch my brother
All that anti-violence shit goes out the window along with you
And the rest of your team
Smoking cigarettes to look cooler
I only stop by to look through ya
And I'm only getting greedier
And I'm still Mr. Youmedia
And I still can't find Talent
And I'm still choosing classmates that wouldn't fuck
Mom still thinks I should go back to school
And Justin still thinks I'm good enough
And Mama Jan still don't take her meds
And I still be asking God to show his face
And I still be asking God to show his face


I am a new man, I am sanctified
Oh, I am holy, I have been baptized
I have been born again, I am the White Light
Rain, rain don't go away


This is my last shh- my last shit
Uhh, it definitely be mad important
Ey man, that sound like a Prince song


Still a chain smoking
Name dropping
Good looking
Muh' fucking
Motha, shut your mouth
Brain broken
Frank Ocean listening
Stain hitting, satin woodgrain gripping
Paint dripping
Motha, shut your mouth


Somebody pray for the god, oh lord
I wonder what Michael's on
Son jammin' to his shit
Rappin' trappin' trippin' 'cid
And sniffing glue and chewing Vicodin
Shoulda died- yelling YOLO was a lie
And you a liar wonder why you wanna die so young
You and I look just alike
And I'm afraid that this one right here
Might be last time that I write a song
Lot of niggas wanna go out with a bang
But I ain't tryna go out at all
So I ain’t tryna go out at all
Got a lot of ideas still to throw out the door
Last chance joint gotta be a dance joint
From an introspective drugged out standpoint
Throw bands joint, wanna hold hands joint
Old school for my own old man joint


Still a chain smoking
Name dropping
Good looking
Muh' fucking
Motha, shut your mouth
Brain broken
Frank Ocean listening
Stain hitting, satin woodgrain gripping
Paint dripping
Motha, shut your mouth


This part right here, right now
Right here, this part my shit
I play this so loud in the car
I forget to park my whip
I lean back, then spark my shit
I turn up, I talk my shit
Hope you love all of my shit
I hope you love all of my shit 


Why toss my filter when she saved my life?
The same shit that kills us, always feels so right
That's why I pray to the dear lord
God know who he be
Truth be told he juiced me
Introduced me to the lucy leaf
Oh oh oh, I seen the light, I lost my lighter
Bic flick, kick the habit and the bucket, fuck your supplier
Lies, Levis on fire
Flyer on the wall I'm brighter
In the darkness of the night
In the sky I get higher, higher


Still a chain smoking
Name dropping
Good looking
Muh' fucking
Motha, shut your mouth
Brain broken
Frank Ocean listening
Stain hitting, satin woodgrain gripping
Paint dripping
Motha, shut your mouth


This part right here, right now
Right here, this part my shit
I play this so loud in the car
I forget to park my whip
I lean back, then spark my shit
I turn up, I talk my shit
Hope you love all of my shit
I hope you love all of my shit 


Still a chain smoking
Name dropping
Good looking
Muh' fucking
Motha, shut your mouth
Brain broken
Frank Ocean listening
Stain hitting, satin woodgrain gripping
Paint dripping
Motha, shut your mouth




Ken: Well I should have you hooked up next week

Chance: It's all good or whatever, I can wait 'til my birthday. I uh-

Ken: No, no, no, no. I told ya, I know you need it now, so next week I promise you I'll have you hooked up, ok?

Chance: Oh, alright. I just wanted to say thank you for everything. For the computer, the T-Shirts, and all the other stuff

Chance, you have done remarkable and wondrous things, so you don't have to tell me thank you for anything. I'm supposed to do this, that stuff for you anyway, and ya know, just keep doing what you're doing. I am very, very proud of you. Just keep doing what you're doing, ok?

Chance: Thank you, love you

Ken: Alright, son. Love you too, take care

Chance: Bye bye
Thanks for coming guys


'Member sittin' in class the first time listening to Dilla
Everything's good
Rubbin' on yo chin, sippin gin, Margiela brand chinchilla
Everything's good
My manager backpack packed with packs of cigarillos
And some fruit snacks, And some killer's
Phone numbers on speed dial call them save monkey guerillas
Everything's good
I ain't really that good at goodbyes
I ain't really that bad at leaving
I ain't really always been a good guy, I used to be thirsty thievin'
Runnin through purses even persons leave em hurtin' bleedin
I ain't really help the helpless
I used to be worse than worthless
Now I'm worth hooks and verses
I'm good like books in churches
Harolds and Hooks and Churches
Everything's Good
See my name when you google search it
Use a card when I make a purchase
Everything's Good
But I knew it was fly when I was just a caterpillar
That I'd make it even if I never make a milla,
When I meet my maker he gon' make sure that we chillin'
And everything's good
I ain't really that good at goodnight, I ain't really that bad at sleepin
With bad bitches, put them aside, I used to be thirsty creeping
Now I'm out working evenings birthdays even Tuesdays Wednesdays Thursdays weekends, rehearsing verses, murdering merch and events
Damn it feel good to be a gangsta
And it feel good for me to thank you
Put money back in your bank account
Off of songs I barely could think up,
Cause a lot of songs niggas gon' make up
Make sense, but they never gon' make a sound
I'm better than I was the last time, crescendo
Thanks Justin, lending them pencils
Mr. Menzies, Mensa, Chris Minto
The time I beat Chris on Nintendo
Nanana hey hey, good intro,
Remember jacket shoppin' after listening to Thriller
Remember the first time you heard this through and thought, "damn that's that nigga."
Everything's good


Never let me down
For the kings have decreed 
Righteousness shall be
Show us thy love, oh
Have mercy upon thy soul
Never let me down, no man
Happened today like nothing
DJ Khaled!


I wanna say thank you for the time and the love that you share
All the help and the effort just to get me there
When everyone turned their back you showed me how muched you care
You believed in me, never forget you I swear
I'll always be strong, my character defines me
I will never be that hateful and throw stones behind me
Temptation and ego can get you so wrong
A lot of people easily forget where they're comin' from


I'm so grateful for all you've done to bless your soul
With the riches of love forever
Happiness shine as a burning sun
It's a blooming blessing, hey
Let it flow, it's a pleasure


Hours upon hours searching for a better way out
And the evil and ignorant people sending the choppers
Still just gotta look out
Jah is my guide, I know I'm here for a reason
Put my trust in the Most High
And my prayers are so consistent, ah
Who would've thought it would be like this today?
Nothing but prayers lift up your head
Lion in the jungle, I tell ya
He who have been blessed...


Welcome to Grateful
Strength is strength, strength is strength
You realize and appreciate your blessings
Embrace your blessings from the heart
To express your gratitude by doing righteous deeds
Asahd, my son - I love you
Thank you God
I also want to thank all my enemies, for turning they backs on me
Thank you, I'm so...


I'm so grateful for all you've done to bless your soul
With the riches of love forever
Happiness shine as a burning sun
It's a blooming blessing, hey
Let it flow, it's a pleasure
Hours upon hours, searching for a better way out
DJ Khaled!
I'm so grateful for all you've done to bless your soul

Ran to the dealer, bought twin Mercedes
The European trucks for the twin babies
Don't let me have a son, I'm a fool, haha 
Send him to school in all my jewels, haha
I want a boy and girl to fight for truth
Whatever God give me, I'm cool

She the one that bring them rain drops 
We go back, remember criss-cross and hopscotch? 
You the one that hold me down when the block's hot 
I make your dreams come true when you wake up 
And your look's just the same without no make-up
Had to pull up on your mama, see what you're made of 
Ain't gotta worry 'bout them commas 'cause my cake up
You can run inside my life from that fame bus 
'Cause I promise, when we step out you'll be famous 
Modern day Bonnie and Clyde what they named us 
'Cause when we pull up — brt-brt! — all angles


Yeah, you're lookin' at the truth

Then she went and put that booty on that Gucci belt
We don't got no label
She say she want bottles, she ain't got no table
She don't got no bed frame, she don't got no tables
We just watchin' Netflix, she ain't got no cable, okay though
Plug, plug, plug, I'm the plug for her
She want a nigga that pull her hair and hold the door for her
Baby, that's only me, bitch, it okay with me

Don't make me catch a body
That's for any and everybody
Oh, my God! She hit me up all day, get no response
Bitch, you blow my high
That's like turnin' gold to bronze, roll my eyes
And when she on the Molly she a zombie
She think we Clyde and Bonnie
But it's more like Whitney and Bobby
God, forgive me! Tunechi F finessin', I'm a legend
Straight up out the Crescent
Fly your bae down for the Essence
For the record I knew Khaled when that boy was spinnin' records
Mula Gang, winnin' record

Multi-million dollar plays and that's a hundred ways
Fuck a fashion, we could match in my Hermès seats
Top down, JFK, I pray he get impeached
Say no names, Supreme underwear and like 80 chains
Hundred for the rich forever perspective, never change
Petty bitches postin' niggas like they would win in pictures

I just left work to work some more, I'm still a workaholic
I done sacrificed it all, paid the dues and costs
Life will test us all, let's see if we true or false
I walk up to my fate and stare that shit in the face
Hungry for the competition, bitch, get on my plate
No mercy, no grace, I'm checkin' off my to-do list
There's no room off in the schedule
It's only room for improvement
And I realized all I ever needed was in me, nigga
S on my chest, boy, so shots can't even pinch me, nigga
No substitute for me, but they gon' still tempt me, nigga
God is in me, that's the only one who can end me, nigga
And we seen more blessings than a Baptist Ebenezer
My daddy says: "You got a good girl, she's a keeper."
Boy, I'm a Caesar, I see shit and seize it
Roc-A-Fella chain, but you can still get Ether'd
Yeah, they don't really fuckin' feel me

I'm principle driven, only real ones feel me
Most needed protection from the OG's to get bigger
No disrespect to them, but I never needed them older niggas
Or so we thought speedin' through life like
The speed of sound – what your life like?
Momma stressin', seen the ratchets in the dresser
She not askin' questions
Seen the vests, seen other kids in the caskets restin'
Life ill, 'cause most of my niggas in jail
For them it was hustle or death, I reshuffled my deck
I gave myself a good hand
Probably ran through a hundred million
Per decade, I'm not phased, and I could spot ya
A hundred million before you could ever spot grays
Chili Fritos in the helicopter
Money can't get that ghetto out'cha

Watch out for insecure niggas
They take your soul out your body, they not secure
I pray the Lord stop a opp before I go backwards
Resort to violent reactions
That's childish, my life's a dream to rappers
Afraid they moments have past 'em
It's all different hustles 
Niggas movin' bricks
Young niggas rappin', doin' shows, hittin' they licks
Everybody holdin' shmoney in pics
Don't get robbed, boy, is you dumb?
All them swipers gettin' it how it come 
43, morally ambiguous, you serious?
Gettin' it, lyricist, idiots, you ain't nearin' this
Out of New York's biggest and richest
I'm the template, low-key the busiest
The game chose me, deal with it
So I'm the quiet type, Mr. One Mic
But silently listen, use the same letters to spell it right
So hear me, from Nasty I'm mature
Here's another appetizer

I just got back from
Where they said I couldn't get back from
And I thank God, I thank God that I made it
They surprised, they surprised that I made it
Heart is like diamonds, keep blindin' their faces
I wonder how I keep finding these places
I can't explain how it feels to be patient
Killing the drama, we finally made it, hey-yeah


Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Nobody knows, nobody but you
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

I got something inside of me that can't be quenched
I'm addicted to winning and I can't be benched
Go to war for every black queen that they lynched
And my pockets on chubby but they can't be pinched
Uhh, after they use you, then they abuse you
Then they get mad when they lose you 
You know the liar will accuse you
You know the queen still reign, it's just business as usual
Anything I touch, I bless it, track record so impressive
Opened the Billboard Awards with a hit record
The devil thought he had me
But I rebuked him, got money and I'm still a baddie


I just got back from
Where they said I couldn't get back from
And I thank God, I thank God that I made it
They surprised, they surprised that I made it
Heart is like diamonds, keep blinding they faces
I wonder how I keep finding these places
I can explain how it feels to be patient
Killing the drama, we finally made it, hey-yeah


Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Nobody knows, nobody knows
Nobody knows, nobody but you
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Nobody knows, nobody knows
Nobody knows, nobody but you


Say nobody knows
All the trouble I've seen 
Glory, looking for some glory
From all the trouble I've seen 
Tell em' nobody knows, all my sorrows
Nobody knows what tomorrow


I just got back from
Where they said I couldn't get back from
And I thank God, I thank God that I made it
They surprised, they surprised that I made it
Heart is like diamonds, keep blinding they faces
I wonder how I keep finding these places
I can explain how it feels to be patient
Killing the drama, we finally made it, hey-yeah


Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Nobody knows, nobody knows
Nobody knows, nobody but you

We the Best Music!
DJ Khaled!


Please, Khaled, don't pair me or compare me
Unless the said party is a rare breed
The stories I hear, they tend to mirror me
At this point now, rap is only therapy
President Push, I'm more Eric B
I ain't no joke, check out my melody
Felony, felony, felony, that's all they selling me
But two million in large bills is billing me
I was on the wrong side of the law
Like Pac was on the wrong side of the car
Like B.I.G. at the Soul Train Awards
The moral is all greats been driven
G-Wagons are bulletproof
The ones before me got snatched like bullet tooth
Tony nigga, only one left from the drug era
The jewelry weighs more in the drug mirror


Yeah, what you see when you look in the mirror, nigga? Haha
Yeah, I know who the fuck I am


Yuugh, tell me how you fit in
Was you a street nigga when Nas said It's Written
When Reasonable Doubt dropped, how was you living?
I was leading up the grinding in my kitchen
Getting work from Detroit like a piston
We was on a mission, stuff it in a Michelin
I could spend a year reminiscing
The length of your career, reminiscing
We can't occupy the same space
We ain't even running the same race
When it come to these bitches, it ain't the same chase
Moynat versus Celine, we ain't the same taste
Therefore, it's no comparison
To be mentioned with you niggas is embarrassing
I am one Joe blow, you know my narrative
Clear your sinus like Claritin
Push


When you look in the mirror, what do you see, nigga?
'Cause I know when I look in the mirror, I know what I see
You peasants don't deserve my presence


You portraying other individuals
Me, I'm just weighing my residuals
From where success is the bare minimal
You a rapper, I'm a criminal
I had money before they found y'all
That's why I feel funny around y'all
Lord, bless those praying for my downfall
If I get too deep, don't let me drown, y'all
Hearing 'em talking 'bout how to flip a key
Started moving that Daddy Kane and Nicky D
Had the whole YPD sick of me
Don't sit, if you get tired, just pick a knee
Bet it all or bet it large
Now the coke or the pills or the crack, all these credit cards
I just laughed and I shrug at it
'Cause the niggas with the money are the drug addicts
Kiss
DJ Khaled!


From the mud to the marble floors, minks galore
Hustlin' on the corners, now we own the stores
Fuck a million dollars, boy, I need a billi' for sure
Ch-ch-ch-cheer tuckin' Billy Ocean, Billy Ocean
More Billy's, more problems
We got too many ways to solve 'em
My life is like a movie that made the Oscars

I got my car back, I'm John Wick
The sky blue tint come equipped with the convicts
The don's slick, some Billys we gon' get
Broke a leg in my debut, no Bogut 
Talkin' sports trades with Pecas
While sides cheat on their husbands, those be the best vibes
Satin grain on the hood of the car
Switch lanes, yeah I used to flood the hood with them jars
You can get a taste for a flat out key
'Cause now-a-days I'm Klay, see my spot up 3
Draped in Hermes scarves, crusing the Riviera
More solid than gold bars, the Billy era


From the mud to the marble floors, minks galore
Hustlin' on the corners, now we own the stores
Fuck a million dollars, boy, I need a billi' for sure
Ch-ch-ch-cheer tuckin' Billy Ocean, Billy Ocean
More Billy's, more problems
We got too many ways to solve 'em
My life is like a movie that made the Oscars
Turned a key into a billion dollars, Billy Ocean, Billy Ocean


Hermes sweatsuits and S-Coupes
Fly around, NBA money in jets too
Back of the bag's all crunched out, we vexed too
Should've been Billys in '92, line who? The shine's new
Yeah it's sorta like a mafia movie
Sit back, Rocky and Groovie with the '9-2
Silk pieces in Velez's sneakers
A duffle bag with handcuffs on it, we creatures
Ayo, runnin' every strip club, lit love
Yeah we sit around and just drip bub', the homies get piff love
To all the realest ones and rich thugs
One, my hundred niggas, Billy, we gun on niggas


From the mud to the marble floors, minks galore
Hustlin' on the corners, now we own the stores
Fuck a million dollars, boy, I need a billi' for sure
Ch-ch-ch-cheer tuckin' Billy Ocean, Billy Ocean

I'ma go get that Wraith
Jumping out with your bae
I just wanna get this paper
I'ma do, I'ma do, I'ma do what it takes
I'ma go get that cake, I'ma go pull a caper
I'ma do, I'ma do, I'ma do what it takes
I'ma go get that cake, I'ma go pull a caper
I'ma go, I'ma go, I'ma go get that Wraith
Jumping out with your bae
I just wanna get this paper


I got you, Khaled, it's Wizop
It's the Dapper Don going on a trapathon
Serving coked out food and kush, I call it a triathlon
In a red Dawn with an Amazon
She pissed me off, I just found out she got her panties on
A year ago seen niggas get stabbed over honey buns
It may sound funny to you, found out he got punctured lungs
I just want the funds, I don't rap for fun
I rarely post the money, I never pose with guns
Went from a robber to the upper upper echelon
Just to get here I had to rob a couple Mexicans
But free Kodak Black, bring Lil' Kodak back
Cause they don't wanna see you move into their cul-de-sac


I'ma go get that Wraith
Jumping out with your bae
I just wanna get this paper
I'ma do, I'ma do, I'ma do what it takes
I'ma go get that cake, I'ma go pull a caper
I'ma do, I'ma do, I'ma do what it takes
I'ma go get that cake, I'ma go pull a caper
I'ma go, I'ma go, I'ma go get that Wraith
Jumping out with your bae
I just wanna get this paper


It's do or die on my side of things
Destiny is my livelihood
I'm Iverson with the long braids
Three cellphones with the gold fronts
Wild thing 'til I Yao Ming
Five rings, past nine seasons
Big money, that's our thing
Heavyweight, I Ali 'em
Featherweight how I leave 'em
Heaven's sakes, God's need 'em
Bob weave rock the Colosseum
I'm the biggest nigga, you got gonorrhea
Baddest bitches make my collage
Biggest buds make my cigars
Basic bitches and custom cars
Blowjobs in the SLR's
Realest ones wanna watch you shine
Smoking good and I'm talking facts
Iced out like DJ Khaled
Burn it down with Kodak Black


I'ma go get that Wraith
Jumping out with your bae
I just wanna get this paper
I'ma do, I'ma do, I'ma do what it takes
I'ma go get that cake, I'ma go pull a caper
I'ma do, I'ma do, I'ma do what it takes

DJ Khaled!


Fucked the DA on my way here
I made some millions on my way here nigga
I seen your comment on my way here
I laughed my ass off on my way here nigga
Bentayga with the brain bust open
That new Mulsanne got the brain bust open
Play them racks like Jimi Hendrix on the guitar
Load my gun, cock it back and then I push start
I can't name how many times they tried to clone me
I can't name all the names that tried to clone me
This dirty money help me see the devil
Sidity thots, know they ain't forever
My trials and tribulations playing out on blogs
Spend three hundred thousand or better, that's on all the cars
The Maybach park itself, nigga
That Range Rover came with steps, nigga
Electric tables in the back, I'm eating filet mignon
He been 44'n all year, I put that Rollie on
Trapping good all year, put the Rollie on
They parading in the streets, you gotta keep a drum
Say a prayer for my young nigga, know he dumb
The murder rate going up nigga
I done ran this check up nigga
Get hit up from the neck up nigga, yeah
The Goyard looking like a graveyard
Murder money, I'm in love with murder money
Old friends of me turned into my enemy
My money and fame changes niggas into enemies
All my hard work and lonely nights no sympathy
Want to send a hit but too far in the industry
I feel your energy, I know you niggas envy me
They rep the gang that bangin' it out in penitentiary
I watch the shit come out your mouth and it's finicky
I'm tryna love you but I doubt I'll scream infinity
With these billions on my mind, it's hard to be cohesive
Gettin' that A-Rod money like I hit the needle
Keep a spanish mamacita like a Fanta liter
And I gave 'em all dope and they pissed off
Got my lil Haiti babies waiting so they can wack ya
I got my Memphis Ten niggas waiting to jack ya
I got some DC niggas waiting to kidnap ya
I got the clappers, finessers and the trappers
Before the rap change, you gotta go dap em
Don't forget to look at niggas when they after ya


I told Future I can see the future
Told my bitch I love you 'fore I knew you
I know I'm blessed nigga, hallelujah 
And if you diss me then I might shoot ya 
You don't fuck with me, the feeling mutual 
Half these rap niggas owe they jeweler 
I was selling keys to success
I was coppin' keys outta Texas
New Wraith with the stars in it
New Porsche, condo, living room cars in it
Ace of Spades with the Percocet and bars in it
Young shooters, real soldiers put they heart in it
Let's talk 'bout all this money we make and all these niggas they hatin'
Let's talk 'bout runnin' that bag up fast cause we ain't got no patience
Let's talk 'bout poppin' 'scripts and Xans like we're patients
And them fed's allegations will have you pacin'
Million dollar dope boy, I gotta be grateful
You tryna get that 100 mil', I'ma race you
Dope boy, I ain't never wanna be a rap nigga
Billboard reporter LA Reid just signed a trap nigga
New York Times read Jay Z just signed a trap nigga
Kitchen like it's Thursday, you heard? Might bring it back nigga
You fuckin' the money up if I'm being honest
Gotta be grateful, I never break the promise, I know my plug love me
I know my bitch hate me, I heard my hood salty
I tried to tell 'em it ain't my fault, it's just my blessings called me
But since they hatin' on an nigga I'ma keep ballin'
And I ain't textin' that bitch back because she keep stallin'
If she ain't fuckin first night then she just miss her callin'
Fuck a plea, I'm goin' to trial, poker face, I'm all in
Patek Philippe, AP, 40 mil', I’m all in
Plug hit my line I act like I ain't see 'em callin'
I worked so hard for mine I'm tryna get some free bands
I'm the king of the city, my house Graceland
No respect for rappers, they respect the coke man
That's why your favorite rapper actin' like the dope man nigga

Lambo wings, fly out the nest
We do not settle for less 
I'm in the ghost with no head 
I'm thankin' the Lord 'cause I'm blessed

Pockets on Gotti, we pull the street in big body

Been a player since the very beginning
Stones in my charm, never my denim, no
Chain flooded like the livin' room, huh, incredible
Rappin', it was either that or sellin' dope, shit, let the dice roll
Now diamonds all on top of diamonds, huh?

Minimize my mistakes, love every tat on my face

I thought I'd probably die in prison, expensive taste in women
Ain't had no pot to piss in, now my kitchen full of dishes
Nose bloody from that sniffin', your heroin addiction
Trigger finger itching fuck parental supervision
This be that murder business, little Timmy got that semi
I ain't kidding hide yo kittens, hit yo children with that Smith and
A bunch of ignant little niglets, hard headed, never listen
Purple sippin', finger twistin', teeth glisten like it's Memphis
A bunch of hypocritic Christians, the land of no religion
My Santa Claus was missing, catch you slippin' then it's Christmas
Motherfuck a wishlist, my ghetto was ambition
For my benjis and my Bentley, and them bitches now I gets gets
On the road to riches, a diamond ring, designer jeans
Choking on that biscuit till I'm no longer existing
I wonder if they miss me, as long as I make history
Now my soul is feeling empty, tell the reaper come and get me


Who said you can’t live forever lied
Of course, I’m living forever I’ll
Forever, I’ll live long
You can’t ever deny
My force, I’m living forever I’ll
Forever, I’ll LIVE


Riding through your city like that motherfucka mine
Or choking on that semi, rob a motherfucka blind
License plate says wipe me down, car from 1989
But a nigga sits so pretty call that motherfucker fine
Lost your motherfucking mind, what's on your mind niggas talking down
Never talk to cops, make him talk to God when I tote that 9, he ain't talking now
Tell 'em watch your spine, I mean watch your back
Better guide your track, better not look back
Now stay in line, don't step on cracks
So you break her back I'm talking 'bout your mom
Cause there's killers in my town, making hits, sniffing lines
Out committing crimes, wait for shit to simmer down
Corrupted little minds, 8 and 9, finna shine
On the grind, do you dirty with that shimmy shimmy ya
Where they shoot without a purpose, services 'n hearses
Kids who ain't deserve it, can't survive a thing, you're worthless
Strangers make me nervous, who's that peekin' in my window with a pistol to my curtains?


Who said you can’t live forever lied
Of course, I’m living forever I’ll
Forever, I’ll live long
You can’t ever deny
My force, I’m living forever I’ll
Forever, I’ll LIVE


Pretty nigga rich, Flacko be the shit
And that bitch, know we poppin' so she boppin' on this dick
Nigga, R.I.P. to Pimp, can't forget Little Flip
And I take it out to Memphis so shout out to Triple Six


Who said you can’t live forever lied
Of course, I’m living forever I’ll
Forever, I’ll live long
You can’t ever deny
My force, I’m living forever I’ll
Forever, I’ll LIVE
I said it must be cause a nigga got dough
Extraordinary swag and a mouth full of gold
Hoes at my shows they be strippin' off they clothes
And them college girls write a nigga name on they toes
Niggas talk shit 'til they get lockjaw
Chrome to ya dome 'til ya get glockjaw
Party like a cowboy or a rockstar
Everybody play the tough guy 'til shit pop off


Let's take it to the basis, you in the midst of greatness
My Martin was a Maison, rocked Margielas with no laces
Cristal go by the cases, wait hold up that was racist
I would prefer the Aces, ain't no different when you taste it
A 40 ounce to chase it, that's just a understatement
I'm early to the party, but my 'Rari is the latest
Somehow it seems girls in they late teens
Remind me your favorite jeans cause they naked cause you famous
Life's a mothafucka, ain't it? These other rappers ain't us
So tell me what your name is, I'mma tell it to my stainless
You aim it 'fore you bang it let that banger leave you brainless
It's just me, myself, and I and mothafuckas that I came with
Miscellaneous niggas wanna hate on me
Until I tell 'em to they face they ain't no G
Low key, niggas mad cause I'm smooth puffin' Zig Zags
Tell 'em quit the riff raff bitchin' with your bitch ass


I said it must be cause a nigga got dough
Extraordinary swag and a mouth full of gold
Hoes at my shows they be strippin' off they clothes
And them college girls write a nigga name on they toes
Niggas talk shit 'til they get lockjaw
Chrome to ya dome 'til ya get glockjaw
Party like a cowboy or a rockstar
Everybody play the tough guy 'til shit pop off


Yes, I'm the shit, tell me do it stink?
It feel good wakin' up some money in the bank
Three model bitches, cocaine on the sink
And I'm so 'bout it 'bout it, I might roll up in a tank
Cause my chain came from Cuba, got a lock up on the link
And them red bottom loafers just to complement the mink
Eyes chink, rollin' up that dank, blowin' on that stank
What you mean? Tell me what you drink, I'm on that kissin' pink
You could call me Billy Gates, got a crib in every state
Man on the moon, got a condo out in space
Open up your legs, tell me how it taste
And them niggas talkin' shit so tell 'em, "Tell it to my face"
Tell that bitch, hop up on my dick, rolled up on her quick
In a six, told her suck a dick, motorboat her tits
I'm the shit, niggas mad cause I'm smooth puffin' Zig-Zags
Tell 'em quit the riff raff bitchin' with your bitch ass


I said it must be cause a nigga got dough
Extraordinary swag and a mouth full of gold
Hoes at my shows they be strippin' off they clothes
And them college girls write a nigga name on they toes
Niggas talk shit 'til they get lockjaw
Chrome to ya dome 'til ya get glockjaw
Party like a cowboy or a rockstar
Everybody play the tough guy 'til shit pop off
Everybody play the tough guy 'til shit pop off
All I think about is life, nights, sipping on Sprite
Little codeine, nigga get throwed right
Two blonde dykes wanna kiss all night
I just pray to God that the shit go right
Little argument, and their fists don't fight
Fuck a dog ho and the bitch gon' bite
A$AP nigga, sip Cris all night
So them R. Kelly hoes getting pissed on twice
Damn, how a young nigga get so nice?
Young nigga cold like he sitting on ice

Hoes screaming that Pac back
Throwing Westside, bandana tied
A$AP life, got a Pac tat
Harlem world my whole block strapped
Hoes all on my jock strap
My whip white but my top black
And my bitch white but my cock black
Purple drink? Got that
Tell these hoes all to twerk something
Bounce on me bitch, hurt something
Tell her pop that pussy like it's worth something
So shorty, she a stunner and daddy, he a runner
Be that pretty mothafucka, you could call me what you wanna
Cause I'm in love with that ass, she in love with the cash
So she shaking it fast and then making them stacks
And I'm taking it back and I'm taking her back
To the house just to bust in her mouth and I'm kicking her out


How 'bout me and you and you and I
Take a ride to make this high
On and on and on and on
On and on and on and on


So I say pussy, money, weed
Pussy, money, weed
Pussy, money, weed
That's all a nigga need


It's A$AP Q, where the bread at?
Fuck around and bring the hush puppies back
She fuck me and the homies, she was cool with that
The block hot so I'm shaded in my bucket hat
Pause a little bit, I gotta little advice
If you fucked her once, then you could fuck her twice
And don't get head from hoes with overbites
Just giving out game, nigga show your right
Born stunna nigga, turn night to bright
High as a kite in my Nike Flights
Made 30 Racks it was just a flight
Flew a bitch out too, it was just a night
Shorty got the booty make a nigga say, "Whoa"
Can I suck your titties, tryna see how far I can go
Try again and then again and she ain't telling me no
Sweetie tell me how you feeling, can I feel on you more?
She said, "I ain't fucking for free," but ain't shit I can't afford
Shit, I'll pay you for it, now bounce that ass on my bungie cord
Yeah, whoopsie daisy, put a good kid in your Section.80
Turn a baby into a lady, now here go the keys to my new Mercedes
Cause shawty she a stripper, all you got to do is tip her
She like ballers with some money screaming fuck them other niggas
Now do A through Z for a G, panties go down to her feet
Pussy get wetter for me, smackin' that ass to the beat, give her that Diggity-D

However, whatever they seeing on the box
Everybody spit, everybody hot, everybody's an artist, everybody not
S-O L-O-S-T, niggas talking dollars getting change
In a minute I'mma lose my cool, Sprewell one year before '98
Like fuck coach, I’m cutthroat, so what goes
Do you head for the year they say might be the end?
Better look within


Glitz and the glamors, we pose for the cameras
Ghetto niggas with me, they pose with the hammers
Ghetto girls with me, pink toes in the sandals
No dirty laundry, get your nose out my hamper
Clothes in my hamper, that bathing ape camouflage
Brands from Japan, you would think I was a samurai
Drop-crotch Jeremy Scott pants, bitch it’s Hammer Time
Getting dirty money but I keep my hand sanitized
Life is what you need, won't you take a Z, feel the breeze
Smoke the sour diese', hit that shit and please, act at ease
What you wanna be like the Black Eyed Peas, all these steezs
S-T-A-R-S, that’s Hollywood, won’t you rest in peace?

Make me think about all of the rappers I've been feedin' on
Got a feelin' that's the same dudes that we speakin' on
Oh word? Ain't heard my album? Who you sleepin' on?
You should print the lyrics out and have a fuckin' read-along
Ain't a fuckin' sing-along 'less you brought the weed along
Then ju… 
Then just drop down and get yo' eagle on
Or we can stare up at the stars and put the Beatles on
All that shit you talkin' 'bout is not up for discussion
I will pay to make it bigger, I don't pay for no reduction
If it's comin' from a nigga I don't know, then I don't trust it
If you comin' for my head, then motherfucker get to bustin'
Yes, Lord, I don't really say this often

Say she from the hood, but she live inside in the valley, now
Vaca'd in Atlanta, then she goin' back to Cali, mmm
Got your girl on my line, world on my line
The irony, I fuck 'em at the same damn time
She eyein' me like a nigga don't exist
Girl, I know you want this dick

That mean your friends-es need be up to par
See, my standards are pampered by threesomes tomorrow
Mmm, kill 'em all, dead bodies in the hallway
Don't get involved, listen what the crystal ball say
Halle Berry, hallelujah
Holla back, I'll do ya; beast


I love bad bitches, that's my fuckin' problem
And yeah, I like to fuck, I got a fuckin' problem
I love bad bitches, that's my fuckin' problem
And yeah, I like to fuck, I got a fuckin' problem
I love bad bitches, that's my fuckin' problem

And yeah, I like to fuck, I got a fuckin' problem

If findin' somebody real is your fuckin' problem
Bring your girls to the crib, maybe we can solve it


Wake up feeling blessed up, pistol on that dresser
Ain't afraid to show it, I'll expose it if I dress up
Riding in that Testa...rossa, nigga catch up
Sipping on that syrup 'til I'm messed up like yes sir
So now I'm getting change, people looking at me strange
Like nigga switching lanes, never changed, still the same
We fuck bitches, get paper, you fuck niggas on papers
We walk around with lasers, you prolly own some tasers
Lame niggas disgrace us, they girlfriends want date us
Got different hoes, I'm pimping hoes, you could tell by my paystubs
My niggas gettin' right, smokin' weed with dirty Sprite
Going wild for the night, fuck being polite, I'm goin'


Finna wild out for the weekend, me, myself, and I – my three friends
Nigga feeling froggy, then leap in, A$AP niggas finna sneak in
Middle finger to the critics, me and my nigga Skrillex
You know we finna kill it, A$AP we the trillest
You don't really want that Glock boy
You don't really wanna feel them shots boy
You a b-boy, I'm a block boy, I'm a D boy, I'm a hot boy
Six shots got me feelin' like Pac, boy, party all night, shit don't stop, boy
Drunk as fuck and I'm ready to fight
Wilding for the night, fuck being polite, boy


Wild for the night, fuck being polite, I'm going
Wild for the night, fuck being polite, I'm going
Wild for the night, fuck being polite, I'm going
Wild for the night, fuck being polite, I'm going


It's the weekend and I'm creeping with my niggas
Drunk and disrespectful, callin' women bitches
I don't mean no harm but won't you and your friends
Meet us in the cut and we can do the business
God my witness that I only wanna kick it
And your girl just said they with us
So we rolling in them Benzes
Won't you pour it up and stop the babysitting
She got drunk as fuck and swallowed all my kids


Back to the Mac, tats on her back
Ass so fat, hit that from the back
When it clap from the back, she clappin' it back
She flat on her back and it's back to the trap
Fuck your pack, A$AP where it's at
Fuck nigga act, get clap lay flat
Fuck your dreams, leave a punk nigga dreamin'
Then you sleep, and you won't come back from the nap
Benjamin Three-Stack, it’s a fact, she lives in my lap
On my Outkast, daddy fat, bitches on my sack
And you know them smokin' bitches rolling reefer got me open
Wildin' to the morning with my homies, tell 'em where we going


Wild for the night, fuck being polite, I'm going
Wild for the night, fuck being polite, I'm going
Wild for the night, fuck being polite, I'm going
Wild for the night, fuck being polite, I'm going


Feeling like a vigilante or a missionary
Tell my A$AP killers get they pistols ready
Send 'em to the cemetary with obituaries
Don't be scared, nigga, is you ready?
I've been thinking 'bout all the O's in my bank account 
X the hoes in my bed is 'round the same amount 
Ever since this new star fame came about
Or ever since me and Drizzy started hangin' out
Young boy, let his gun bang, let his nuts hang
Transition to a Lamborghini from a Mustang
Drugs slang in the drug game with the hustling
 Anything is better than that 1 Train
Bag made of Goyard, cheffin' like I'm Boyar-
Dee, probably selling D in your local courtyard
Braids like I'm O-Dog, my la familia go hard
Down to my inlaws, they outlaws with no laws


We outlawed then I bogart, any pros that got 'proached at
With a toe-tag, get broke off, in the projects with a skateboard
I roll past and I blaze y'all like, "DOO DOO!" I hate y'all
When the beef cooked, I ate y'all like, "Mmm mmm,"
Let's play ball in a ballpark with all sharks and a blindfold
I rhyme cold, my K hot, your 9 cold, that bark like K9's on
That banana clip, straight from the rip
I'll make that shirt say RIP, I'm on some shit
If I'm not the hottest then Hell must've froze over
You thought it was safe then forgot what the code was
I carry traits of a traumatized soldier
Don't look in my face, I might snap, I might choke ya
Spine right out of place, give me dap like you 'posed ta
Darts at your posters, dark nights like this
I metamorph like I'm 'posed ta, I might slice my wrist
Or pretend like a vulture and drop off this cliff


Barely even conscious, talking to my conscience
Gettin' deeper in these flows like conches
I'm on my convict, don't drop bars, I drop prisons
Don't sell rocks, seen the spectrum through the prisms
Somehow bypassed the bias and the -isms
The violence and the killin', so given
They seen my pigment and thought that was the ign'ance
Unfortunately I am not that type of niglet
But pass the pot, let me skillet
Just got back to the block from a 6 o'clock with Jigga
And I'm thinkin' 'bout signin' to the Roc
But my niggas on the block still assigned to the rocks
And I swear it hurt me soul
I try to prevail, but when I preach it only hurt their sales
Like you're only gon' end up either dead or in jail
But you my nigga, wish you the best for real


When you mention my name amongst other white rappers
Or for that matter, any fuckin' rapper, fuck it
Painter, skater, musician, trailer park dirt ditch diggin'
Burger flippin', eat, sleep, shittin' human bein', you would be in
Trouble to body double or couple me to these others
Cause comparatively speakin', my reach is beyond the bubble
That they put me in, my vision's beyond the Hubble's
I huddle with Nubians, new beginning again
You in school at 10, late, Radioactive's goin' gold
And so? GREAT. Do I give a flying duck
If I'm applyin' love to my rhymin' plus alignin' us?
Alabama's climbin' up, wait, no I don't give a
Flying duck, nothing but a buckshot, Ch, pow!
Motherfuck your life, pussy blood clot
Ain't never been no rapper this cold since 2Pac was froze
And thawed out for a spot date at a Coachella show, Yelawolf


Weed a different color like a hoodrat bra and panties
And my flow be overhead like pots and pans in pantries
Antsy cause I'm high like Michael Jackson penny loafers
Moonwalkin' on the sun, barefoot, with shades on
Bitch pussy smell like a penguin
Wouldn't hit that shit with my worst enemy's penis
Bitch when I say this I mean this: Ho, I'm the meanest
Dick so big, it’s like from Earth to Venus
That molly got me nauseous, aw shit, no off switch
Lawless, obnoxious, on that "suck my cock" shit
That is my synopsis, ostrich posh shit
Hoes on some goth shit, stop it! You not this!
Novice, regardless, heartless and awkward
Cryin' tears of vodka prima donna at the concert
Adonis smokin' chronic 'bout to vomit gin and tonic
Just bein' honest, tell me, isn't that ironic?


Swiftly, I shift the Bimmer 860
A heavy smoker so you know I brought the Blake with me
The moon’s reflection off the lake hit me
You should've stayed with me, now many Asian bitches lay with me
The face is silky like a tablecloth
My shorty gallop in the morning on the beach like a Chilean horse
Red roses dropped from boxes very often
Confetti torchin', drinking Henny like I'm Kenny Lofton
Outstandin'
I fixed the game between Georgia Southern and Gramblin'
You see us scrambling, selling Susan Sarandon
The cloud of smoke like the phantom
Damn this shit tastes like fantastic
You see me comin' through in each state
Just so the lord could put the fork inside the cheesecake
Cuffed to my wrist, I’ve got the briefcase
The gavel slam, I’m a free man, try not to eat ham


Big KRIT, shawty
Spit like my last breath: casket rap, six deep
Eyes closed, the black is back, out come the 'Lac with flats
After that, bottles I can’t pronounce, like, “How you ask for that?”
Why you ask for crack and all you had was scratch?
All I had was rap, when all they had was wack
All I wanted was love, all they had was dap
Fuck them haters and fuck them hoes, a championship win is
The aftermath, ask Le
Bron, open palm slap a bitch
Walk the plank or break a bank, I’ve been in the business of sinkin' ships
Chokin' niggas out with the anchors that they anchor with
Resuscitations cost the label, I’m taxing if you want a hit
Clear, fuck your career, bitch, I was born here
Been a killer, '86er, nigga, that's my born year
Get the fuck from 'round here, that's just my country ways
Suckin' on your momma's titty, bitchin' while I was choppin' blade
Grippin’ grain, fuckin' hoes, candy paint like Everglades
Miss me with that rapper chatter, take that shit up with my bass
I put that on my sub, how could you ever doubt me?
Most rappers hoping the world end so they won't have to drop another album
B.B. King saw the king in me, so why can't you?
In order to come up close, you’ll have to dig up Cash and Elvis, too

Muddy water flow, Dixie rebel past
Fuck your Louis flag, popping benji tags on your wifey’s ass
That’s out of line, but in living color?
I’m more like Miya Bailey on you rap motherfuckers, a true artist
Her pistol go "bang-bang, boom-boom, pop-pop"
Her pistol go "bang-bang, boom-boom, pop-pop"
I said her pistol go "bang-bang, boom-boom, pop-pop"
Cause she a fashion killa, and I'm a trendy nigga
I said her pistol go "bang-bang, boom-boom, pop-pop"
Her pistol go "bang-bang, boom-boom, pop-pop"
I said her pistol go "bang-bang, boom-boom, pop-pop"
Cause she a fashion killa, and I'm a jiggy nigga


Rocking, rolling, swagging to the max
My bitch a fashion killa, she be busy popping tags
She got a lotta Prada, that Dolce and Gabbana
I can't forget Escada, and that Balenciaga
I'm sipping purple syrup, come be my Aunt Jemima
And if you is a rider, we'll go shopping like mañana
Her attitude Rihanna, she get it from her mama
She jiggy like Madonna, but she trippy like Nirvana
Cause everything designer, her jeans is Helmut Lang
Shoes is Alexander Wang and her shirt the newest Donna
Karan, wearing all the Cartier frames
Jean Paul Gaultiers cause they match with her persona


Her pistol go "bang-bang, boom-boom, pop-pop"
Her pistol go "bang-bang, boom-boom, pop-pop"
I said her pistol go "bang-bang, boom-boom, pop-pop"
Cause she a fashion killa, and I'm a trendy nigga

Her pistol go "bang-bang, boom-boom, pop-pop"
I said her pistol go "bang-bang, boom-boom, pop-pop"
Cause she a fashion killa, and I'm a jiggy nigga


I see your Jil Sanders, Oliver Peoples
Costume National, your Ann Demeuelemeester
See Visvim be the sneaker, Lanvin or Balmain
Goyard by the trunk, her Isabel Marant
I love your Linda Farrow, I adore your Dior
Your Damir Doma, Vena Cava from the store
I crush down with that top down, bossy see how I ride 'round
Mami in that Tom Ford, Papi in that Thom Browne
Rick Owens, Raf Simons, boy she got it by the stock
She ball until she fall, that means she shop 'til she drop
And Versace: got a lot, but she may never wear it
But she save it so our babies will be flyer than their parents


Her pistol go "bang-bang, boom-boom, pop-pop"
Her pistol go "bang-bang, boom-boom, pop-pop"
I said her pistol go "bang-bang, boom-boom, pop-pop"
Cause she a fashion killa, and I'm a trendy nigga

Her pistol go "bang-bang, boom-boom, pop-pop"
I said her pistol go "bang-bang, boom-boom, pop-pop"
Cause she a fashion killa, and I'm a jiggy nigga


Scoop back tees, breeze in the coupe
Smiling is your treasure, you're so well put together
Bags and links, jeans and shoes
Spikes and patent leathers, different fabrics mixed together
You and me, me and you
Go away together, we could get away forever
All emotions clashing, thrashing, someone turn the light out
I met my baby expressed my passion on my fashion night out


Her pistol go "bang-bang, boom-boom, pop-pop"
Her pistol go "bang-bang, boom-boom, pop-pop"
I said her pistol go "bang-bang, boom-boom, pop-pop"
Cause she a fashion killa, and I'm a trendy nigga
I said her pistol go "bang-bang, boom-boom, pop-pop"
Her pistol go "bang-bang, boom-boom, pop-pop"
I said her pistol go "bang-bang, boom-boom, pop-pop"
Cause she a fashion killa, and I'm a jiggy nigga
Bloody ink on my pad spelled suicide
Michael Jackson even passed cause you scrutinized
Fuck illuminati lies, say I'm lucified
Baptised in the gutter, motherfucker you decide
Cause the ride come with doors that be suicide
Or the thighs on my whores, they be super-sized
Good and bad having wars, nigga, choose a side
Now all hail to the Lord like you do to God
Who am I? Lord Flacko
Painting vivid pictures, call me Basquiat, Picasso
Capo Head Hancho, now my following's colossal
Ain't no boxer, Pacquiao, but got the chopper todo caso
It's like you heard God spoke, I seen the ghetto gospel
The choir like my reefer and the preacher got my eyes low
Sister Mary Jane to make me sleep from singing high notes
The bible or the rifle, goodnight folks


Bloody ink on my pen spelled suicide
Kurt Cobain even died cause you scrutinize
It's a fine line between truth and lies
Jesus Christ never lied, still was crucified
That's why I never judge another nigga
Life's a bitch, but that bitch in love with other niggas
3 to a bed, sheets, no covers nigga
Dirty kitchen, no supper in the cupboards nigga
Sucker niggas, wassup with niggas?
So my new attitude is like "Fuck them niggas!"
I grew up with niggas but don't fuck with niggas
I don't trust them niggas, ain't got no love for niggas
Had the gold grills shining like them southern niggas
Kept it trilla, now the whole world fuckin' with us
Meanwhile you treated all of us like other niggas
Now your world is in my palm, take cover niggas


If I shall ever fall, Lord pick me up
Ever since a baby, two deuce in sippy cups
Ever since them diapers and my zip-me-ups
Now I'm walking on my own, y'all, wish me luck


Where do we lie
Tell me where do we stand
Where do we go
It's all part of the plan
Where do we lie
Tell me where do we stand
Where do we go
It's all part of the plan
I swear this famous shit just happened overnight
For sure these hoes was so uptight, but now they so polite
All I see is fake love, smiles and overbites
But I'm pimping, nigga: Dolemite
I remember when, I was like ten, maybe nine
Ricky had a deuce-deuce, two shotty pumps with a baby nine
Busta had the rhymes, Puffy had the Shyne
Bone Thugs had Mo Thugs but that was the shit, that made me rhyme
What's up, what's on your mind? Hold up, I'm feeling fine
Locs got me blind, thugging like I'm Eazy-E up in his prime
Another young nigga with a attitude
I guess that's why the crackers kept me after school
Roaches on the wall, roaches on the dresser
Everybody had roaches but our roaches ain't respect us
On the park bench playing checkers, sipping nectar
Girbaud jeans with hologram straps and reflectors
We had cookouts and dirt bikes and dice games and fistfights
And fish fries and shootouts like one Sig with two rounds
And one click left two down, that's four kids but one lived
Left three dead, but one split, that one miss, that one snitched
That's everyday shit, shit we used to that
Add it up, do the math with your stupid ass
Don't view me as no conscious cat, this ain't no conscious rap
Fuck the conscious crap, my mac'll push your conscience back
I do this for my culture, penny, nickels in the sofa
Mommy watching Oprah, Daddy in the kitchen whipping soda
Cook-connect named Sosa, Spanish chick Viola hit it in the chocha
With the Testarossa, hit Daytona, fuck the law, we soldiers
I'm 'bout it 'bout it, nigga ain't shit sweet about me
The baddest bitches on the block be even speaking 'bout me
I'm so thuggish ruggish bringing ruckus, knucking if you bucking
Young and thugging, bugging showing out in public, but you love it


I only got one vision, that's for kids in every color, religion
That listen, we gotta beat the system, stay the fuck out the prisons
They try to blind our vision, but we all God children, we siblings
You my brother, you my kin, fuck the color of your skin


Back once again
Chilling in the back of the 'Lac with a pass or the gin
Finna ask can I pass to her friend
Then a nigga smash, I'll be damned if I ask her again
Gold slabs on the 'Lac when I spin
Then it's back to the back of the Benz
Lean back in the back with the Henn and a crap
When I tap that that, then attack, never tax, never that that
Max on the ends, spend ends, I remember way back when
A mothafucka used to have to borrow cash from my friends
Friends, just to put a snack up in the fridge
When I'm on, I swear to God to pay you back
Now the kids all look up to me
Them bitches wanna fuck with me
My idols say what's up to me
From ugly to comfortably, suddenly


It all changed man, it was just like yesterday
Times was so ugly and now I'm comfortable
I just only can thank God, suddenly
Everything changed before my eyes by my surprise
A$AP
Bitch motherfuckers trying to fake it trill
Sneak diss you just to make a bill
Now the world won't take you serious
When I met you, you was painting nails
Leave a motherfucker layin' still
B-bang him with the stainless steel
Cause I'm making the order
Laugh at the altar, pullin' a Lord up
Don't get someone sawed up
Your brain in a sawdust, niggas is washed up
I bang out in Florida
Shoot in Miami, goons out in Georgia
Been to New Orleans
But still a New Yorker, nigga the talk of
Town, nigga we bossed up
Bounce, but when you talk to the Lord
Of course you're forced to
Bow down like a motherfuckin' peasant
Still that pretty motherfucker
And you know Harlem's what I'm reppin' nigga


Fuck them other niggas cause I'm down for my niggas
Fuck them other niggas cause I'm down for my niggas
Fuck them other niggas, I'll ride for my niggas
I’ll die for my niggas, man, fuck them other niggas!


Lord, please talk to me Lord
I am here for you Lord


Gettin' faded, hair gettin' braided, Sophie sniffed a line of ye
Playin' spades, bumpin' Jimi Hendrix "Purple Haze"
A 40 to the face, call my homies from around the way
Give me that pussy, I'll be on my way
But grab the jimmy so the bitch don't get no cash up out me
Pretty nigga, I'm a jiggy nigga, ask about me
Fuck niggas talkin' trash about me
But you know I toke a gauge, it can make any problem go away
Talkin' Jay, talkin' Ye, that mean you niggas talkin' cray
Razor blade across your face, I fix my face then walk away
I guess then there's nothin' more to say
Trill nigga to the death, whether Hell or the pearly gates
I think back to my early days
Whippin' and pinchin' that broad dough
It's a bit different now, switchin' and flippin' that raw flow
Substance get me higher, reefer and some fire
The devil is a liar, biased preachers shall retire
Jesus walked on water, I'm preachin' to the choir
Long live A$AP, now bow to your Messiah, bitch!


Let the Lords toast with the Lords
Toast to the Lords
When come Gods, come Lords
Lords! Lords! Lords!
Oh Lord! Toast to the Lords!
As we live this day, please pray for us
When comes the saints, comes the evils, brings the Lords
Do just what I tell you
Don't come in any closer
And no one will get hurt
‘Cause I don't know how long I can hold my heart in two


A rebel I be one day, on that track with Gunplay
Outcast my whole life so I decide to spit like André
Beef is on my entree, gin and juice, that's Bombay
Driving fast the wrong way, I swear life is like a one-way
Pussy on a Sunday, business on a Monday
My new crib came with feng shui and my closet is like a runway
Come be my fiancee, she fuck me in a Hyundai
My rooftop got a lounge, just sit around and watch her sunbathe
Dinner date for one K, shopping date for two K
Bougie-ass bitch made me wait to fuck for two days
Finally got it today, swear to god my mood changed
Top off like toupees, drop off, touche
Yeah, my mouth is full of gold and I'm a city boy
And my outfit was in Vogue, I'm a pretty boy
Bounce, boy, Flacko tell 'em holla at a nigga, G
Riding on my enemies, this my ghetto symphony


Don't come in any closer
Don't come in any closer
Don't come in any closer
Don't come in any closer


Whipping Whitney, my mama as a witness
Bitches lickin' and locking up my swishas
Once she blow my whistle, she know it's dismissal
Spread the news I'm official, now hop out my foreign vessel
Before I get aggressive forget it, war ready
Already tested, tears and blood invested
Till my cardiac's arrested and my 40 ounce is empty
Show me what you owe me and a porterhouse with that
Black magic on the tires only I
Rolling down a lonely mile, phony smile
Warrants, police on me now, still tourin'
And my chain it may slow me down cheer for
Pain, in its purest form
Don't complain I came to reign from here forward, still noid
So crib got clear doors
Burning planes in my Air Force and all I can see is clear ports


Don't come in any closer
Don't come in any closer
Don't come in any closer
Don't come in any closer...


Since Rocky spit like André, I'm gon' kill 'em like Big Boi
These rappers is on my entrée, eat 'em like cookies, Chips Ahoy
Mm, enjoy, when I get annoyed, know a couple niggas that'll kill for joy
Either Gunplay, runway, trip avoid, body get found by a lil' fishin' boy
Arnold Schwarzenigga, toss a nigga
Like codeine mixed with a roid
Slow punch make a nigga chin collide
That's for talking how fast you could grip a nine
Damn, look how the hollow tip hit his spine
Little motherfuckers that commit the crime
These niggas got the sidewalk sipping wine
Guess that's why the ground sip the wine
Pouring liq so I soak in lift and shine
Tip tipped and toe I miss the sky
My soul gets cold when my niggas died
So and so, niggas live and die
Beneath shoe soles you will reside
Rappers get a mil for these freakin' lies
Sign a couple deals for these freakin' lies
How many times in your eyes has a nigga died? Never!
Spittin' it like a Beretta, nobody do it better, nigga
Ten gold chains, wood grain, propane
Sell the whole thang from the cellphone rang


I'm the dope mane, bitches sniffing cocaine
All my young niggas know that they could always
Call me, call me, call me 
Call me, call me, call me 
Call me, call me, call me 
Call me, call me, call me



They call me young drug dealer, they call me young thug nigga
24 karats my slugs glitter, 24 years old worth a couple million
Shouts out to my cuz niggas, finna let it fly for my blood niggas
Middle finger up to you fuck niggas, if you a trill nigga, then fuck with us
Nigga dash like a speed of a bullet
With a pistol on him prolly wouldn't even pull it
Heart made of pudding mean mugging with a hoodie like what's goodie
Trying to be the mothafucka that you couldn't knowing you
Down to let it fly when I shouldn't
All my young niggas they gon' rep it to the fullest
Tell a fuck nigga "be you," fuck tough be cool
All the young niggas in my crew, they down to let it fly


For a nigga like me, young nigga like me 
For a nigga like me, young nigga like me 
For a nigga like me, young nigga like me 
For a nigga like me, jiggy young nigga like me 


Ten gold chains, wood grain, propane
Sell the whole thang from the cellphone rang
Ten gold chains, wood grain, propane
Sell the whole thang from the cellphone rang


Niggas got rips in they jeans man I started that
Hood by air man I started that
Niggas claim they the God of black
Well your name is purple I'm the God of that
Gave you my back nigga pardon that
Fuck that shit I brought mobbing back
I brought robbin' back, I brought the Garden back
Motherfuck black land I brought Harlem back
Rolling in my Benzo, hoes on the curb a couple of friends
Rolling down my window, yo what's the word, fuck it get in
Ride round with these bimbos, she give head to my kin folk
Shout outs my connect though, keep a watch out for them Winslows
Cause the boys gon' creep, D-boys gon' serve
Hoes gone skeet and the V gone swerve
I'mma get by while the world gon' turn
I'mma get mine like you gon' get yours
Niggas do the least do when the piece got nerve
Niggas in the streets want heat, get burned
Tell a nigga "be you," fuck tough be cool
Couple young niggas down with my crew who be done and let it fly


For a nigga like me, young nigga like me 
For a nigga like me, young nigga like me 
For a nigga like me, young nigga like me 
For a nigga like me, jiggy young nigga like me 


Ten gold chains, wood grain, propane

Ten gold chains, wood grain, propane
Sell the whole thang from the cellphone rang
Ten gold chains, wood grain, propane
Sell the whole thang from the cellphone rang
Ten gold chains, wood grain, propane
Sell the whole thang from the cellphone rang
I thought you said you’d never leave
I think back as I took a puff
Know what happens every time you leave
Always come back ‘cause you wanna fuck
Always come back ‘cause you wanna fuss
Holdin’ back, ain’t no turnin’ back when you fall in love
Know what happens every time you speed
Always fall flat ‘cause you wanna rush
So we could take it slow
Separate the highs from the lows
Separate the evens from the odds
I just hope you put me back together when I come apart


I come apart, and you keep it together
I come apart, and I can’t stand the pressure
In all your grace and favor for me, I cannot compare
I come apart, this can’t last forever
Can’t last forever


I woke up today high
Felt a little less pressure from you
And I’m here to say I
Maybe even learned a lesson from you
If you find a way to fight the pain which we endure
If you fly away then rest assured


I come apart, and you keep it together
I come apart, and I can’t stand the pressure
In all your grace and favor for me, I cannot compare
I come apart, this can’t last forever
Can’t last forever


You’re the eye, but I’m tearing all the time
Always there to catch me, but I’m never coming down
Reconstructing all the pieces I left in my way
I guess you know, in control
Chaos I create
I come apart


You made a bet with me, now you’re in debt with me
Made my bed, lied in it, then you slept with me
It’s ruthless, she the closest thing next to me
The truth is, that she blew it and you left with me
Especially hard to express to me
European attitude but born in West Philly
She just have a smokin’ ‘gina, where the Wet Willies?
I come apart, I’m in her heart on her left titty


I come apart, and you keep it together
I come apart, and I can’t stand the pressure
In all your grace and favor for me, I cannot compare
I come apart, this can’t last forever
Can’t last forever
