Observe the high roller
Mic controller
Number one hip-hop son
Call me solar
Why? cause I shine
Praise the Big Willie I'm
Raised in Philly I
Daze and thrillin' ya
Don't be silly, ya can't see me
Again I'm killin ya on MTV
Just get with it my friend
Dat kid done did it again
Da fantastic
Boombastic
Gettin' ten times hotter than any you other cats get
Practice
You lack this
I'm the real Mc
Coy
First with Jeff I was startin
Then with Martin I'm a Badboy
See more green than David Banner
More juice than Tropicana
You hawkin me like Atlanta
MC's just flee, they rightfully concerned
Big Will wants the mic back, it's my turn ta burn
I'm back attackin the mic
Hype like a Viking
Strikin like a python
Blaze like Jon
A hip-hop icon, MC radical
Back on track from my rap/act sabbatical
Nine-point-six on the richter
Kicked her, hands so slickta
Chicks quickta flip tha
Bright glance and the tight pants
For the slight chance, 
Big Willie can we get one dance? 
Why yes you may an', I'm just sayin
That dress you playin, is A-Okay an
This is your chance for, at least it could be
For you an you girlfriend on the dancefloor, menege-boogie
On the scene I fronts an dashin, fashion
Lost my cream once, now I'm stashin cashin
Countries and currencies, like a true Don
I's a new time and this time watch me shine
The way y'all blaze through the days and nights
How I deal with the craze my momma raised me right
Whether I'm on stage or in the studio booth
100 proof, raisin the roof, raisin the roof! 
Y'all know, Can't nobody rock a crowd like me
She know, Can't nobody make it bounce like me
He know, Can't nobody get it hot like me
Y'all know, Y'all need ta stop cause ya can't see me
Seven continents I bruise all cruise
Adidas, kilts, or bamboos and no shoes
Eskimos to Abariginies
I'll test the flow of the world's MC's
I'll hit you out the ball park
You just all talk
Don't be lookin at my script, you can't play my part
See I'm a rapper thats an actor
You act rap with no heart
The way that I compose those flows like Mozart
Gets somthin like a symphony, when I'm orchestratin' em
Ever since the days of me an Jeff at the Paladium
All my life I've been the cream of the crop
Shoppin a dream, now I got a crop full of cream
I raise mics for the flow of it, you know the show of it
Not the Benz 600 four door of it
I'm a rhyme regardless of earnin
Long as my heart keeps yearnin
I gots ta keep burnin
On your mark ready set let's go, dance floor pro
I know you know I go psycho
When my new joint hit, just can't sit
Got to get jiggy with it, ooh, that's it
Now honey honey come ride, DKNY
All up in my eye, you got a Prada
Bag with a lot of stuff in it
Give it to your friend let's spin, everybody looking at me
Glancing the kid, wishing they was dancing a jig
Here with this handsome kid, ciga-cigar
Right from Cuba-Cuba, I just bite it
I's for the look, I don't light it
Illway the an-may on the ance-day oor-flay
Give it up jiggy make it feel like foreplay
Yo my cardio is infinite, ha-ha
Big Willie style's all in it, getting jiggy with it
Getting jiggy with it
What you want to ball with the kid? 
Watch your step you might fall
Trying to do what I did
Mama mama mama come closer
In the middle of the club with the rub-a-dub
No love for the haters, the haters
Mad cause I got floor seats at the Lakers
See me on the fifty yard line with the Raiders
Met Ali he told me I'm the greatest
I got the fever for the flavor of a crowd-pleaser
DJ play another from the prince of this
Your highness, only mad chicks ride in my whips
South to the West to the East to the North
Bought my hits and watch them go off a go off
Ah, yes-yes y'all
Ya don't stop in the winter or the 
I makes it hot, getting jiggy with'em
Eight-fifty I.S. if you need a lift
Who's the kid in the drop? Who else Will Smith
Living that life some consider a myth
Rock from south street to one two fifth
Women used to tease me, give it to me now nice and easy
Since I moved up like George and Weezie
Cream to the maximum I be asking'em
Would you like to bounce with the brother that's platinum? 
Never see Will attacking'em
Rather play ball with Shaq and'em, flatten'em
Psych, kidding
Thought I took a spill but I didn't
Trust the lady of my life she hitting
Hit her with a drop top with the ribbon
Crib for my mom on the outskirts of Philly
You trying to flex on me? 
Don't be silly, getting jiggy with it
Excuse me Miss, can we chat for a second
I'd ask how you doin', but you fine I reckon
Wait, do you have a man, cause I ain't' into homewrecking
No?...Aight cool just checking
Look, from a hundred yards you caught my eye
An all my boys said I didn't have the heart to say hi
I'd like to have your number you don't have ta give it now
But if you diss me while they lookin I'm a never live it down
Y'know what I mean, Aww damn, my name's Will
Maxine. Pleasure to meet you, look here's the deal
Can I sit? Thanks, now I don't mean to objectify
But this the metaphore that crossed my mind
You sweet, good enough to eat
Make a brother wanna TLC--Creep
A brother can't sleep
I's like a kid fallin for you
So here's my own private nickname, I'm a call you
Candy 
I's the same feelin I always seem to get around you
Let's get this started now
Let's get this started now
I ain't gonna lie to you, I remember layin eyes on you
All I thought about was livin life beside you, Boo
All I wanna do is be the perfect guy to you
Tell you the truth, it's like  cause I'm feelin like its callin me
You're tryin ta hold on, but fallin
Seem quite far ta me
I stay strong but it's hard to be
Cause somethin bringin out the dog in me
 when I'm keepin my zone
Chat on the phone, I lower my tone
Steady plottin on takin ya home
Gettin all inside of your dome, makin you moan
You shoulda known 
As I'm seein you here, Mommy I know your peepin my stare
And feelin my glare, brother thinkin bout unrollin the bear
Strokin your hair,  Yeah there
I know the deal, I talked to Mary Jane and she said
Your ex-boyfriends Mike and Ike are both Lemonheads
I ain't tryin ta player hate girl I know
That you go with Bazooka Joe
Now you know he don't love you like that
He tryin ta get a Reeses piece of the Kit-Kat
Really hon, what he need is a jawbreaker
Cause I'm the one that'll love you baby Now and Later
Be my Peppermint Paddy with a Hundred wishes
An I'll be your Hershey daddy with a hundred kisses
Get the Twins M&M's, they booked all outta flights today
Me an you can Starburst to the Milky Way
I don't care what it cost, girl a Hundred Grand
We could snicker all night at my Jolly Ranch
Just me and you, I'll call your friends up too
Cause I could get my friends Babe Ruth and Charleston Chew
Early mornin' wake up
Gently with the caress on your hand
And that kimono that I bought you on my trip to Japan
Sunshine peekin through the venitian blinds
Four years, and like wine, you got finer with time
I got a question, if the pradda dressin and the Gucci
All got goes, and the freeze on the Lucci
I mean real bad girl, I'm talking rougher than rough
Do you think it'd be enough if we just had us? 
Don't answer quick, think about it cause I'm askin for real
Golddiggers goin' to hear this song drivin and crash at the wheel
Forever is a long time, so far we gettin along fine
No car I ever drove, no ice I ever saw
No music I ever made, ain't nothin I wanted more
We could deal with whatever together
Sunshine, all that other weather, when we chasin forever
I wanna stay with you forever
I wanna spend all my life with only you
I wanna stay, lets stay together
Chasing forever, with only you
Chasin forever, a buckwild, endeavorous scene
Should we pursue with somethin real or just chasin a dream
Or casin' the scene
Fore I die I plan
To see your soul and eternity in the palm of my hands
Now as a man, there's certain things I'm lackin for sure
But I'm committed to growin and coming at you mature
In the future, I know it ain't gonna be all good
But when we feelin the hurt, if we willin to work
The eight ball will never turn to see us behind
Though I ain't no knight, and my armor don't shine
My mom said the lynch pin of love is trust
An taught me monogomy is uh, monogamous
Plus, for you dinner by candlelight
Now don't commit before you sure you understand me right
I's a race to a strange place, most see never
I's a chase we gotta make together, forever
Now you would think after all my heartbreaks I'd be cruel
Hiding behind my ego, evil but no
Much the contrary, I'm very much certain
You searchin for joy, it's on the other side of hurtin
Finally found a person, worthy of all
Instead of pushin me down, you wanna cushion my fall
Your eyes could make the sun rise, all the birds sing
Seal it with a kiss, bind it with a ring
More carrats than even bugs could eat in a week
An the ribbon in the sky, close your eyes don't peek
I'll tell you what I see in the future
A hacienda so cute with, five little kids callin you mom and callin me dad
Havin more good times than JJ had
Judging by the look in your eyes, you see it
Let no man sever, welcome to forever
I am Keith B-Real, story breaker, keeping it real

Don't try to act like this summer at the greek
You won't be bumpin' the big Willie in your jeep
I know y'all still feel me
Really don't act silly
Thought I feel off just becuase I left Philly
Took a break from the rap thing went on hiatus
I picked up the art of acting and multiplied papers
I chilled on silk sofas chatting with Oprah
She asked me if it's true that me and Jeff broke up
While y'all kids busy playing drug pimp and playa
I was at my crib in Barbados chillin' with Jada
Vertex is me the magnanamous
Got you sayin' damn I've always been a fan of his...

Man I love being me ready to rock the block
With some more hot top notch ---- for you to cop
No more mr. nice guy
My whole life I've been smiling when I felt like whiling
Jealousy swinging on me made his attack
You beleive that
It hurt me at first but it's cool
Took the insults feed it to my ego used it for fuel
Now everywhere I turn a dead end
Hundred women coming at me waving pads and pens
And they be screaming out

Bangok to Madagascar they wanna see me
Prince epe in Spain Japan I'm cota eshe

And my son to ride in the cockpit
I know he's only four taking lessons from the pilot
While I'm on my cell with my broker getting stock tips
Find a magazine and I read the hottest gossip
Man who'd a thought my life would be such an interesting topic
Well y'all know how it is wait hold up y'all don't
Well look here y'all don't say nothing than I won't

Shorty get ice five carrots and nothing cheaper
Four five chromed out former two seater
Fifty inch Sony to watch Siskel and Ebert
Cause I'm about to get two thumbs ten toes one knee and probably a couple
Of elbows
Cause yo I'm the man and the whole world knows
Rock film festivals and rap shows
All the critics jealous people and back-stabbers
My so-called friends who been nothing but actors
You're way of character but now who's the bomb

Y'all know what it is
Ah damn that's right y'all don't
But look here y'all don't say nothing then trust me I won't

Everyday like a mardi gras, everybody party all day
No work all play, okay

Nothin less than ill, when we dress to kill
Everytime the ladies pass, they be like 
Can y'all feel me, all ages and races
Real sweet faces
Every different nation, Spanish, Hatian, Indian, Jamaican
Black, White, Cuban, and Asian
I only came for two days of playing
But everytime I come I always wind up stayin

Miami the city that keeps the roof blazin
Party in the city where the heat is on
All night, on the beach till the break of dawn
Welcome to Miami
Bienvenidos a Miami
Bouncin in the club where the heat is on
All night, on the beach till the break of dawn
I'm goin to Miami
Welcome to Miami
Yo I heard the rainstorms ain't nothin to mess with
But I can't feel a drip on the strip, it's a trip
Ladies half-dressed, fully equipped
And they be screamin out, 
So I'm thinkin I'mma scoot me somethin hot
In this salsa- merengue melting pot
Hottest club in the city, and it's right on the beach
Temperature get to ya, it's about to reach
Five-hundred degrees
In the carribean seas
With the hot mamis screaming ¡Ay papi! 
Everytime I come to town, they be spottin me
In the drop Bentley, ain't no stoppin me
So, cash in your dough
And flow to this fashion show
Pound for pound anywhere you go
Yo, ain't no city in the world like this
An if you ask how I know I gots ta plead the fifth
Party in the city where the heat is on
All night, on the beach till the break of dawn
Welcome to Miami

And we all know that L.A. and Philly stay jiggy
But on the sneak, Miami bringin heat for real
Y'all don't understand
I never seen so many Dominican women with cinnimon tans
Mira, this is the plan
Take a walk on the beach, draw a heart in the sand
Gimmie your hand
Damn, you look sexy
Let's go to my yacht, in the West Keys
Ride my jetskis, loungin in the palm trees
Cause you gotta have cheese for the summerhouse piece on South Beach
Water so clear, you can see to the bottom
Hundred-thousand dollar cars, e'ybody got em
Ain't no surprise in the club to see Sly, Stallone
Miami, my second home

All night, on the beach till the break of dawn

Lights camera action
The hip-hop attraction
Fresh Priggy
John Bliggy
Player haters been hatin' all my playin' for years
Now they seein' they worst fears as I bathe in cheers
Parades and accolades
All shades and ages
I's me the outrageous
My zeal contageous
The smile inspirator
Aspen to Grenada
One of the only mc's to say cheese with Schwarzenegger
Everywhere I go they know me
Planet Hollywood in Paris accidently spilt a drink upon Naomi
Truth of the matter I've been loungin'
Livin' it up givin' it up
In monopulate surrondings
Been around the world and I-yi-yi
Ain't seen enough of this fly-yi-yi
My attitude pervasive
My effervescence
Bringing you back to the essence
With the...
Yes yes y'all
And ya don't stop
Mic check y'all
And ya don't quit
'bout to slay you worst than the first verse
Packin' my purse but yo without one curse
I survive in rarified air where only few can live
Thoughts in my brain like that train in the fugitive
I pledge allegiance to the soul of the game
Stepped away as Fresh Prince came back with my real name
A rose by any other still beautifies the room
So don't get consumed when a brother's known to gloom
I's semantics but yo it's really good to be back
Never racing the rap just lacing the track
Not serendipity with me it was a plan b
'bout to have an Oscar standin' next to my Grammiesss
Plural mucho no need to talk though
I'm a just do so
I'm comin' at ya with the smoothest slickness
Behold the style lick of this kickin'...
A GQ cover twice
This brother's nice
Vanity fair you saw me there
I discovered life
Outside of rap got the cream and all that
But kinda left a void in me
You can't keep runnin' in and out of my life
Said my mic
Aight
Pump your radio you could record
As they place my welcome mat at the music awards
Coming throgh America tinted in high beams
Rose petals at my feet like I'm Prince Akeem
So to all you player haters while y'all sayin' y'all rhyme
Please stop sayin' Jada cause that name's mine
I rocked the Philly fade with the divin' waves
Yes yallin' till I'm bald like Issac Hayes
Bad eyes or greys back pain or bad legs
I'm a get better with age trust
I thought you was the one hon yeah
When I met you at the freaknin'
Whoever thought you'd be the type to greet and keep secrets
My friends said don't sleep but I did so now I'm reapin'
Desease that I sold I can't believe you so deceivin'
Sneakin' out on the weekends with Michelle
One of your freak friends from the east end she bad as hell
Half black and Indonesian the one that taught you treason
Cupid shoot me on my heart but damn why'd you leave it bleedin'
I gave you no reason to lie
But you choose to live untrue
Knowing how I feel inside
There's no telling what I might do
Cause I gave you
All my mind
All my soul
From the very start
I gave you full control and you broke my heart
I tried to show you a better way of life
But I see that must be what you like
I loved you more than anything
I tried to build the future turn a house into a home
I wanted us to be one flesh and one bone
I's so hard to keep my sanity
Now all I can do is sit back and reminisce
Look at the pictures in the frames yo
Why you playin' games yo? 
As I think back to the beginning we was together
We both loved sports long walks and autumn weather
Both wanted kids and a family a strong personality
I liked the way you handled me
Candles be lit mood set food set you ready yet
That's what you said while you was massagin' my ? ? 
Now look here I could never leave you lonely
Cause the love you showed me had me feeling like you already had known me
'member when you used to blindfold me till I don't see
Use your mind that's what you told me
Kissin' me slowly
Never was the loud type always on the low key
Pretty style but rugged
Damn I brother I loved her
The birds of a feather'sposed to fly together
Guess that don't apply to birds of your kind
Cause you only wanted what you wanted like a poacher
Came to steal my heart and leave me to die
All my mind
All my soul
From the very start
I gave you full control and you broke my heart
I tried to show you a better way of life
But I see that must be what you like
I loved you more than anything
I tried to build the future turn a house into a home
I wanted us to be one flesh and one bone
I's so hard to keep my sanity
Now all I can do is sit back and reminisce
Look at the pictures in the frames yo
Why you playin' games yo? 
I loved you more than anything

'Stead a doin dirt, did work and kept my head up
Set up
For the future, much love to my girl
North Pole got my butt cold 
An I'm feelin 
Touch the ceiling 
You say I smile cause I'm on top of the pie
But yo, the cream can only finance the smile for a little while
My grin got longevity, got family backin me
That's why I'm livin happily
Ever after, love and laughter
Hussle cause I wants to, not cause I have to
Ask yourself, who made the polar caps melt? 
FP, the phenomenon, true Don Juan, Jon Blaze
The Fonz ain't seen my Happy Days
The track plays, I'm in the shades, singin a phrase
They say the clothes don't make the man
Take my hand
Watch me freak this
Ah-mommy's tryin ta creep this
Tryin to entice me to let it off
But nah,  c'mon baby, you saw Set It Off
Proposition by trio, in Rio
Menage Trois, down at the Marde Gras
But nah, my clothes by Versace
My attitude cocky, The scent, Issy Miyaki
Like a felon, no tellin what I do next
I don't front cause I'm paid, but I do flex
Southwestern, crib like a villa
Vacation on a mountain in Manilla
Rhyme spilla, real thrilla
An it's real clear
Y'all talkin East and West, I'm talkin hemispheres
My papa raised no fool
So many zeros on my check it's like, ooooooooooooooooo
Now dad this is a very sensitive subject
Just the two of us
Just the two of us 
Just the two of us 
From the first time the doctor placed you in my arms
I knew I'd meet death before I'd let you meet harm
Although questions arose in my mind, would I be man enough
Against wrong, choose right and be standing up? 
From the hospital that first night
Took a hour just ta get the car seat in right
People driving all fast, got me kinda upset
Got you home safe, placed you in your bassinet
That night I don't think one wink I slept
As I slipped out my bed, to your crib I crept
Touched your head gently, felt my heart melt
Cause I know I loved you more than life itself
Then to my knees, and I begged the Lord please
Let me be a good daddy, all he needs
Love, knowledge, discipline too
I pledge my life to you
Just the two of us, we can make it if we try
Just the two of us, 
Just the two of us, building castles in the sky
Just the two of us, you and I
Five years old, bringin comedy
Everytime I look at you I think man, a little me
Just like me, wait an' see, gonna be tall
Makes me laugh cause you got your dads ears an all
Sometimes I wonder, what you gonna be
A general, a doctor, maybe a MC
Haha, I wanna kiss you all the time
But I will test that butt when you cut outta line, true that
Uh-uh-uh why you do that? 
I try to be a tough dad, but you be makin me laugh
Crazy joy, when I see the eyes of my baby boy
I pledge to you, I will always do
Everything I can, show you how to be a man
Dignity, integrity, honor an'
I don't mind if you lose, long as you came with it
An you can cry, ain't no shame it it
It didn't work out with me an your mom
But yo, push come to shove, you was conceived in love
So if the world attacks, and you slide off track
Remember one fact, I got your back
Just the two of us, we can make it if we try
Just the two of us, 
Just the two of us, building castles in the sky
Just the two of us, you and I
I's a full-time job to be a good dad
You got so much more stuff than I had
I gotta study just to keep with the changin times
101 Dalmations on your CD-ROM
See me-I'm tyin to pretend I know
On my PC where that CD go
But yo, ain't nothin promised, one day I'll be gone
Feel the strife, but trust life does go on
But just in case, it's my place to impart
One day some girl's gonna break your heart
And ooh ain't no pain like from the opposite sex
Gonna hurt bad, but don't take it out on the next, son
Throughout life people will make you mad
Disrespect you and treat you bad
Let God deal with the things they do
Cause hate in your heart will consume you too
Always tell the truth, say your prayers
Hold doors, pull out chairs, easy on the swears
You're living proof that dreams do come true

Big Will the high roller
Strolling through with an entourage
Hard to camouflage when you living this large
I be smooth like Debarge with a five car garage
Out for the night with my squad and we be flossing down the fifteen
My whole aura gleaming
Who that kid in the green v
Envy brother scheming
I ain't thinking bout them
Racing chicks in the pink b.m
With my speakers tweakin'
Freaking off this weekend
In Las Vegas boss players all across the board move makers and shakers
Money can't break us but the places it can take us
Big will in the limelight rhyme tight
And we gon' have some fun tonight
Now how we do it
Now how we doing it
Repeat
I'm in a five star casino shutting crap tables down 
Non betting willie watchers standing around
Strictly millionaire status you can feel the eyes looking at us
How bad they wanna be us 
Charlie Mack got my back with his eyes on my stack
Brothers don't know how to act when you drive a four-five black
People stop and stare having drinks at the bar
A round for everybody with these big willie cards
From civilians to stars they wanna know who we are
I's me big Will Nas Escobar J.L. Omar
Carry money bags collect the chips then we all quick to swift exit
I's Left Eye with a tight crew
Representing like it's ladies night
Coming right through
Don't be spiteful
Plus an eyeful, Sporting hot pink
Rocks in the link, In the drop with a mink
Like my shit don't stink
Got you in the palm with a bomb like Saddam
Blowing up spots then running off with the pot
Left Eye ready for action
The main attraction
I'm in the fast lane passing
Breaking you down like fractions
While we be rapping about things that really happen
Big willie style Philly style let's make it platinum
With Mademoiselle from Gezals to Versace
With a sweet smell
This female leading the posse
Got jokes like Cosby
In the lots where the cars be
With no apologies it's Left Eye
Big Will let the champagne spill
Is it a man's thing for real? 
Can us girls roll wit y'all
What the deal
Well now it's looking like a car show
Convoys and whips on the strip
Pulling up in the six making brothers sick
For real
Big Will household name, Entertainer
Gold handle cane and matching gators
Swerving lane
In pole position rolling deep like a coalition
In soul position and can rock a whole convention
Movie screens to the club scene
My whole crew looking clean
Shine with a diamond gleam
Step above where the players be
Don't hate me
One is where they rate me
Lately you could find me
Behind the door marked V.I.P
Eating grapes under the A.C
Big willie style is how we do it
This one goes out to all the big willies
Here come the Men in Black
Here come the Men in Black
They won't let you remember
Nah nah nah
The good guys dress in black remember that
Just in case we ever face to face and make contact
The title held by me: MiB
Means what you think you saw, you did not see
So don't blink be what was there
Is now gone, black suit with the black Ray
Bans on
Walk in shadow, move in silence
Guard against extra-terrestrial violence
But yo we ain't on no government list
We straight don't exist, no names and no fingerprints
Saw somethin' strange, watch your back
Cause you never quite know where the Mi
Bs is at
Uh and...
Here come the Men in Black 
Galaxy defenders 
Here come the Men in Black 
They won't let you remember 
Uh uh, uh uh, now
From the deepest of the darkest of night
On the horizon, bright light enters site tight
Cameras zoom on the impending doom
But then like black suits fill the room up
With the quickness talk with the witnesses
Hypnotizer, neuralizer
Vivid memories turn to fantasies
Ain't no Mi
Bs, can I please
Do what we say that's the way we kick it
Yanah
Imean? I see my noisy cricket get wicked on ya
We're your first, last and only line of defense
Against the worst scum of the universe

Gap teeth in your mouth so my dick's gots to fit

To show you how Death Row pull off that hoo-ride
Now you might not understand me
Cause I'mma rob you in Compton and blast you in Miami
Then we gonna creep to South Central
On a street knowledge mission as I steps in the temple

My niggas coming like the Gotti boys
Bodies being found on Greenleaf
With their fucking heads cut off
Motherfucker, I'm Dre
So listen to the play-by-play, day-by-day
Rolling in my'4 with 16 switches
And got sounds for the bitches
Clocking all the riches
Got the hollow points for the snitches
So would you just walk on by
Cause I'm too hard to lift
And no, this ain't Aerosmith

On a rhyming spree, a straight G
Hop back as I pop my top, you trip
I let the hollow points commence to pop, pop, pop

Go back and take another spot
Cause I'm rolling in my 6-4

Hell yeah
Swing down, sweet chariot, stop, and let me ride
With all the niggas saying
Swing down, sweet chariot, stop, and let me ride
Hell yeah
Swing down, sweet chariot, stop, and let me ride
Just another motherfucking day for Dre, so I begin like this
No medallions, dreadlocks or black fists
I's just that gangsta glare
With gangsta raps
That gangsta shit
Makes a gangs of snaps
And word to these hyped-ass lyrics and dope beats
That I hit you with
That I get you with
As I groove in my'4 on D's
Hitting the switches
Bitches relax, while I get my proper swerve on
Bumping like a motherfucker ready to get my serve on
But before I hit the dope spot
Gotta get the chronic
The Remy Martin and my soda pop
Now I'm smelling like indo-nesia
Bus stop full of fly bitches and skeezers
On my dick cause my'4 on hit
Pancake, front and back, side to side, and all that shit
So when I crawl, I comes correct
Now, if your bitch in my shit, it's your bitch you check, nigga
Now let the Chevrolet slide
As I dip and make a trip to the south side
Yeah
Rolling in my 6-4
With all the bitches saying
Swing down, sweet chariot, stop, and let me ride
Hell yeah
Swing down, sweet chariot, stop, and let me ride
With all the motherfucking bitches saying
Swing down, sweet chariot, stop, and let me ride
Know what I'm saying? 
Swing down, sweet chariot, stop, and let me ride
Check this out
The sun went down when I hit Slauson
On my way to the strip
Now I'm just flossin'
Checking my rearview
Cause niggas, they will do
Jack moves, black fools cause I smack fools
Try to set me up for a 2-11
Fuck around and get caught up in a 
But I don't represent no gangbang
Some niggas like lynching
But I just watch'em hang
So on and so on
Why don't you let me roll on? 
I remember back in the days when I used to have to get my stroll on
Didn't nobody wanna speak
Now everybody peeping out they window
When they hear me beating up the street
Is it Dre? Is it Dre? 
That's what they say
Every single motherfucking day
Yo, but I ain't tripping, I'm just kicking it
While my D's keep spinning and these hoes keep grinning I be
Rolling in my 6-4

Swing down, I wanna ride
Swing down, sweet chariot, stop, and let me ride

I'ma say this and I'ma end mine. If you ain't down for the Africans here in the United States, period point-blank
If you ain't down for the ones that suffered in South Africa from apartheid and shit, dammit, you need to step your punk ass to the side and let us brothers, and us Africans, step in and start puttin' some foot in that ass! 
Break'em off somethin'
Break'em off somethin'
Break'em off somethin'
Break'em off somethin'
Break'em off somethin'
Break'em off somethin'
Break'em off somethin'
Break'em off somethin'
Break'em off somethin'
I got my finger on the trigger, some niggas wonder why
But livin' in the city, it's do-or-die
I got my finger on the trigger, some niggas wonder why
But livin' in the city, it's do-or-die
Dem wonder why me violent and no really understand
For de reason why me take me law in me own hand
Me not out for peace and me not Rodney King
De gun goes click, me gun goes bang
Dem riot in Compton and dem riot in Long Beach
Dem riot in L.A. cause dem no really wanna see
Niggas start to loot and police start to shoot
Lock us down at seven o'clock, barricades us like Beirut
Me don't show no love cause it's us against dem
Dem never ever love me cause it's sport to break dem
And kill, at my own risk, if I may
To lay, to spray with my AK, and put it to rest
Yes, we have—there have been riots, ah, uh, rioting. Well, I don't wanna say rioting, but there's been looting downtown.
But right now, Bree, what I want to show you is, they have started fires down at the end of the street
How many niggas are ready to loot? 
Yeah, so what you wanna do? 
What you wanna do? 
I said, how many niggas are ready to loot? 
Got myself an Uzi and my brother a 9
That's what they told us today
In other words, you still a slave
No matter how much money you got, you still ain't shit
Sitting in my living room, calm and collected
Feeling that gotta-get-mine perspective
Cause what I just heard broke me in half
And half the niggas I know, plus the niggas on the Row is bailing
Laugh now, but cry much later
You see when niggas get together
They get mad cause they can't fade us
Like my niggas from South Central, Los Angeles
They found that they couldn't handle us
Bloods, Crips on the same squad
With the Ese's helpin', nigga, it's time to rob and mob
Yo, straight puttin' it down, gettin' my scoot on
I's jumping off in Compton so I gots to get my loot on
And come up on me some furniture or somethin'
Got a VCR in the back of my car
That I ganked from the Slauson Swap Meet
And motherfuckers better not try to stop me
Cause they will see that I can't be stopped
Cause I'ma cock my Glock and pop'til they all drop
Yes, on the videotape we seem to have the, ah, people in the crowd throwing things at the officers.
And swinging at them as well, as a result a young woman there, you see took a swing at at an officer with some object in her hand.
How many niggas are ready to loot? 
Yeah, so what you wanna do? 
What you wanna do? 
I said, how many niggas are ready to loot? 
Got myself an Uzi and my brother a 9
I got my finger on the trigger, some niggas wonder why
But livin' in the city, it's do-or-die
I got my finger on the trigger, some niggas wonder why
But livin' in the city, it's do-or-die
One-time trigger happy, no nigga love
One-eighty-seven time, time to grab the glove
Can't get prints on a 9 I throw away
Or get prints on my Uzi when it spray
Pop-pop, pop, another motherfucker drop
And I get relief like, plop, plop, fizz
Smash, I crashed his head like a window
I ain't Nintendo, I'm high off the indo
Creepin', with the quickness to the cut
Bust one to his head while he munches on a donut
And crack-up, so now he best to back up
I guess I gots to pack up, filling the clip up
I zip uptown but motherfuckin' cops are all around
Helicopters flyin', these motherfuckers tryin'
To catch me and stretch me on Death Row
But hell no, suppose black refuse to go
This is now covering a very, very wide area of Los Angeles where these fires have been, ah, ignited
I mean, from here to the, ah, to the south end of South Central is a long way.
Break'em off somethin'
Break'em off somethin'
Break'em off somethin'
Break'em off somethin'
Break'em off somethin'
Break'em off somethin'
Break'em off somethin'
Break'em off somethin'
The outcome of this is destruction, so them all fall
Niggas don't give a fuck, so them bust and them fall
The description of three blacks
Shows no justice, so, pick up it's your right
If you riot again, me, turn the other cheek
We, be too many, me got, me nine to my side
So me bust, flick, cause he don't give a fuck
And me don't give a fuck
And all my problems end with that buck-buck
Blam, blam, blam til dem fall
Listen to the shots from my nigga Doggy Dogg, biddy-bye
Dr. Dre, him bust gun shots
Diggidy Daz and RBX, dem bust gun shots
Come again
One, two, three and to the four
Snoop Doggy Dogg and Dr. Dre is at the door
Ready to make an entrance, so back on up
Give me the microphone first, so I can bust like a bubble
Compton and Long Beach together
Now you know you're in trouble
Ain't nothin' but a G thang, baby
Two loc'ed out niggas, so we're crazy
Death Row is the label that pays me
Unfadeable, so please don't try to fade this 
But, um, back to the lecture at hand
Perfection is perfected, so I'ma let'em understand
From a young G's perspective
And before me dig out a bitch I have to find a contraceptive
You never know, she could be earnin' her man
And learnin' her man, and at the same time burnin' her man
Now, you know I ain't with that shit, Lieutenant
Ain't no pussy good enough to get burnt while I'm up in it
And that's realer than Real-Deal Holyfield
And now you hookers and hoes know how I feel
Well, if it's good enough to get broke off a proper chunk
I'll take a small piece of some of that funky stuff
I's like this and like that and like this and a–
I's like that and like this and like that and a–
I's like this and like that and like this and a–
Dre, creep to the mic like a phantom
Well, I'm peepin' and I'm creepin' and I'm creepin'
But I damn near got caught ‘cause my beeper kept beepin'
Now it's time for me to make my impression felt
So sit back, relax, and strap on your seat belt
You never been on a ride like this befo'
With a producer who can rap and control the maestro
At the same time with the dope rhyme that I kick
You know and I know, I flow some old funky shit
To add to my collection, the selection symbolizes dope
Take a toke, but don't choke
If you do, you'll have no clue
On what me and my homie Snoop Dogg came to do
I's like this and like that and like this and a–
I's like that and like this and like that and a–
I's like this, and who gives a fuck about those? 
So just chill'til the next episode
You’ve got the feeling
To rock the other side
You’ve got the feeling 
Fallin' back on that ass, with a hellafied gangsta lean
Gettin' funky on the mic, like a old batch of collard greens
I's the capital S, oh yes, I'm fresh, N double-O, P
D, O, double-G, Y, D, O, double-G, you see
Showin' much flex when it's time to wreck a mic
Pimpin' hoes and clockin' a grip like my name was Dolomite
Yeah, and it don't quit
I think they in the mood for some mothafuckin' G shit
 So, Dre 
Gotta give them what they want 
We gotta break'em off somethin' 
And it's gotta be bumpin' 
Is where it takes place, so when asked, your attention
Mobbin' like a motherfucker, but I ain't lynchin'
Droppin' the funky shit
That's makin' the sucker niggas mumble
When I'm on the mic, it's like a cookie: they all crumble
Try to get close, and your ass'll get smacked
My motherfuckin' homie Doggy Dogg has got my back
Never let me slip, ‘cause if I slip, then I'm slippin'
But if I got my nina, then you know I'm straight trippin'
And I'ma continue to put the rap down, put the mack down
And if you bitches talk shit I'ma have to put the smack down
Yeah, and you don't stop
I told you I'm just like a clock when I tick and I tock
But I'm never off, always on to the break of dawn
C-O-M-P-T-O-N and the city they call Long Beach
Puttin' the shit together
Like my nigga D.O.C., no one can do it better
Like this, that and this and a–
I's like that and like this and like that and a–
I's like this, and who gives a fuck about those? 
So just chill'til the next episode

But, uh, rat-tat-tat-tat that ass
Starting static with Dre, make way for the AK

Not from Kris Kross but they call me Mac Daddy
Had he not known about the city I'm from
Here I come, stomping in my khaki suit
B.G. from the hood, kinfolk Eastwood
God damn, I ripped up, flipped up, and skipped up
On top of things as they swing towards my ding-a-ling
But could you raise up off his nuts?

Hey, I'mma tell you right now, if-if if I have to die today, for this little African right here to have a future I'm a dead motherfucker! 
Wake up, jumped out my bed
I'm in a 2 man cell with my homie Lil 1/2 Dead
Murder was the case that they gave me
Dear God, I wonder can you save me
I'm only 18, so I'm a young buck
I's a riot, if I don't scrap, I'm getting stuck
But that's the life of a G, I guess
Ese's way deep, shanked two in the chest
Best run'cause brothers is dropping quicker
Uh, too late, damn, down goes another nigga
Bouncing off the walls, throwing them dogs
Getting that rep as a young hog
It ain't nothing like the street life
You better be strapped with your shank, cause ain't no fist fight
So I guess I gots to handle mine
Since I did the crime, I gots to do my time
Them say me grow up to be nothing
Look at me now and tell me what you see
I am what I am, it's only me
Little ghetto boy
Playing in the ghetto street
What'cha gonna do when you grow up
And have to face responsibility? 
Now I'm holding a dub, sitting on swoll
27 years old, up for parole, stroll
I'm back up on my feet with my mind on the money
That I'll be making soon as I touch the streets
Things done changed on this side
Remember they used to thump but now they blast, right
But it ain't no thing to me
Cause now I'm what they call a loced-assed OG
The little homies from the hood with grip
Are the ones I get with cause I'm down to set trip
Nigga, I'm bigger than you, so what you wanna do? 
Didn't know he had a.22
Straight sitting behind his back
I grabbed his pockets and then I heard six caps
I fell to the ground with blood on my hands
I didn't understand
How a nigga so young could bust a cap
I used to be the same way back
I guess that's what I get 
For trying to jack them little homies for they grip
Me learn many things from what me from the street
The outcome of what I've come to be
Little ghetto boy
Playing in the ghetto street
What'cha gonna do when you grow up
And have to face responsibility? 
Something for the real OGs to get with
Some facts, made our made, now you wanna run and play
Like every single day, really doe
You know me, I'm the smooth macadamien, gaming them for my homie
No needing being calm if you pack right
And learning just enough to keep your sack right
Late nights, I wonder what they getting for? 
Early morning on the corners, what they hitting for? 
Seven young G's put they serve down
In a G ride, east side's where they swerve now.
Not thinking about what's really going on
Got crept on, stepped on, now they gone
I spent 4 years in the county with nothing but convicts around me
But now I'm back at the Pound
And we expose ways for the youth to survive
Some think it's wrong but we tend to think it's right
So make all them ends you can make
Cause when you're broke, you break, check it out
So ain't no need for your mama to trip
Cause you's a hustling-ass youngsta, clocking your grip
Now me finally grown as you can see, still an OG
For life and always remain to be
Little ghetto boy
Playing in the ghetto street
What'cha gonna do when you grow up
And have to face responsibility?
Yeah, nigga! What's up with all that motherfucking shit you was talking, nigga? 
Hey Dre, why you tripping, why you tripping? 
Fuck that! What was up with all that shit you was talking, nigga?

Who's the man with the masterplan? 
A nigga with a motherfucking gun
44 reasons come to mind
Why your motherfucking brother is hard to find
He be walking on the streets and fucking with mine
Stupid punk can't fuck with a mastermind
See I never take a step on a Compton block
Or L.A. without the AK ready to pop
Cause them punk motherfuckers in black and white
Ain't the only motherfuckers I gots to fight
I think it's better to be telling the facts than cuffed up
And jacked and fucked up
What you niggas looking at? You going
Goddamn!  Cause it's the city
And for you to survive a nigga gotta be a gangsta
And I'm a nigga you can't remove
Took out a lot of motherfuckers for tryin' to prove
To their homies that they can hang by dealin' with me
But once again in the end they D-E-A-D
I never did time on a murder yet
Cause I relax, sit back, do a job and jet
Yo, I know you understand my flow
So here we go with Death Row
Come let a mothafucka know
Who's the man with the masterplan? 
A nigga with a motherfucking gun
Who's the man with the masterplan? 
A nigga with a motherfucking gun
D-R-E
A motherfucker who's known for carrying gats
And kick raps that make snaps
Adapts to any environment that I'm located at
If you see me on the solo move believe that I'm strapped
4-4,.tre-8 or AK-47
Cause slowly but surely send you on a stairway to heaven
Just put my finger on the trigger and pull back
And lay a punk mothafucka flat
As he wonder what popped before he got popped
I told you I was Dre and you know it don't stop
Now I know you understand my flow
So here we go with Death Row

Old buster ass nigga talking bullshit
Don't know that I'm the wrong nigga to fuck with
Get lit or hit up by the doctor:
A nigga that breaks'em off properly! 
Real G so don't doubt it
I'm the one who's doin' it while these other niggas talk about it
And if motherfuckers come at me wrong
I straight put my.44 Desert Eagle to his mothafuckin' dome
And show him why they call me the notorious one
The name's Dre Eastwood when I'm packing a gun
You don't believe me, well step up and give it a try
And if you die, you's a buster cause real niggas don't die
But some still don't hear me though
You're too near me not to hear me, nigga yo

Once again, the mighty Death Row organization committin' mass murder, and we ain't askin' for shit, nigga—we takin' it! So Dre, blast they ass, nigga!

This should be played at high volume
Preferably in a residential area
Now I'ma kick up dust, as I begin to bust
On the wick-wack, fucked up suckers you can't trust
When I kick up, I lick up, your face get smacked up
When I rack up, so all you mothafuckas just pack up
Or get slapped with the swiftness
If you think you're swift with the gift, Merry Christmas
Now stuff that in your stockin'
I'm knockin''em out the box and
Knockin''em out their socks and, cause Robin is rockin'
Breakin''em down to the slab
Takin''em down on their ass
Now what you wanna do, ya wanna battle, uh? 
Send you up shit creek without a motherfucking paddle
Rattle that brain, I'm not that same ol' plain Jane
Roll on you like a boulder, you're nothin' more than a grain
Or a pebble, take it from the real rap rebel
Not Bushwick Bill but I can take it to that other level
You think you got pull? Then pull it, uh! 
I got the trigger so I figure you'll bite the bullet
Then bite the dust and wipe the fuss
Do what I must, and what I must is bust
A bubble, or two some trouble, for you
So skip to my Luger, Lady of Rage is comin' through
Some cool shit
Some cool shit
Boo-yaa! Spittin' out buckshots
I fears no one, I makes'em cool off like a polar cap
Lynchin', as a hit, misses the roll of dice
Pushin' packs to make a profit
Diggy dope duck on the topic so stop and gimme my props, kid
I'm livin' large like a fat bitch
So get back, bitch, I'm hard to bogart, for the faggots
This young black kid, a mercenary, merciless
Murderin' millions of niggas so who's first to diss
They say I'm bad so you'll find none worse than this
Chewing motherfuckers up like a Hershey Kiss
Put to sleep, loving the lyrics I leave in the minds of each
Rough when flex, too complex, wrecks your mental piece
So feel the wrath, nigga, I rip in half niggas
You're quick to talk shit, I whoop your ass nigga
Then watch me blast, nigga, cause I'm the last nigga
You wanna fuck wit', so up your cash, nigga
I make'em stagger, I'm scandalous as Jimmy Swaggart
I'm a good tracker, scopin' your girl then watch me tag her
Pulling steel like a stunt
Shown like an ID card, nigga, no needs to front, so
Here to torment I put track on crack
And I'm strapped with a semi-tone mili-ten Mac
Yo, I breaks'em off, I breaks'em off, chief
Deadly as Jason on Friday the 13th
A to the motherfuckin' K
Back in the days, niggas they use to scrap
But now in ninety two, niggas they pull their strap
Cause umm, police them come wicked and them shoot
Niggas, so niggas retaliate and start to loot, execute
Boot stompin'
Black soldier, here to teach and mold ya
The innovator, dominater, narrarator
R-B to the mothafuckin' X, flex wicked
Styley Lee, bump and be found and do bleed by a
Maniac, with a gat
See nowadays niggas is like that
I pull my trigger back, the bullets go
Bo-bo-bo! Now I'm on Death Row
Fuck it, niggas goin' wild
Every night they shoot, it's like Beirut
Maybe you should get a Kevlar vest for your chest
Anytime steppin' through my hood
But that'll do you no good
One slug to your face, don't hate
You're gettin' smoked like wood
Nasty nigga bloody pumps face flat
On the concrete, here comes the white sheet
Mr. Coroner, caught with some yellow tape
But the murderers escape
Audi like 5 G's
Lyrical Gangbang but it's just a G thang
Yo, yo, what's up? 
Yo, man, give me some of that old, gangsta-ass shit, you know what I'm saying? 
Some shit I can just kick back and smoke a fat-ass joint to, you know what I'm saying? 
Hell yeah, know what I'm talking about? 
I like that old gangsta shit
Cause you know it's a lot of niggas out there
Woofing all that bullshit talking'bout they got this and got that
Talking louder than a motherfucker but ain't saying shit
You know what I'm saying? 
Seven execution-style murders
I have no remorse cause I'm the fucking murderer
Haven't you ever heard of a killer? 
I drop bombs like Hiroshima
So now I walk around strapped
One-time bust they caps and watch niggas collapse
Snap, adapt to this, but you need no adapter
This is just the first chapter
In a book from a crook
You get caught slipping, your ass gots to die
Nigga, tell me what the fuck you figure? 
Trigger, happy RBX to cap you
Pump, pump, and I can't wait to bust a round
Pump, pump, my hollow point smacks the clown
Cause what I said split his head
And now they got me running from the Feds
But I refuse to go alive
I's kill or be killed, that's how real niggas survive
I'm high powered
Yeah
I's Daz that mass-murdering motherfucker
So what you feel like you wanna get caught up? 
Fool you better recognize
Death Row came to chastise
So if you cross the Row
Remember the first name is Death
No love for the other side
Yes, may I help you? 
Hello, I had a 12 o' clock appointment with Dr. Dre
Well, Dr. Dre is with another patient right now
Would you like to reschedule? 
Reschedule? Um, it must be a mistake
I must see him
No, it's no mistake
I had a 12 o'clock appointment
Look Dr. Dre is with another patient, either you can wait or reschedule
Look, I understand all of that
No, apparently you don't understand
You know I'm a working person and
And I work too
Just where is Dr. Dre? I need to see him
Well open up the door and you'll see his big dick fucking somebody
Like that? 
Like that? 
Yes, yes
You like that? 
Give it to me
I'ma give it to you
I'ma give it to you
Damn, you're good
Yes, it is I says me
And all who agree are more than three, cause they we
Yes, yo, I'm in the house now for sure
Because I wanna talk about the hearts of men
Who knows what evil lurks within them? 
But let's take a travel down the blindside
And see what we find on this path, called
Stranded on Death Row, so duck when I swing my shit
I get rugged like Rawhead Rex with fat tracks that fits
The gangsta type, what I recite's kinda lethal
Niggas know the flow that I kick, there's no equal
I'm murderin' niggas, yo, and maybe because of the tone I kicks
When I grip the mic and kick shit niggas can't fuck with
So remember I go hardcore, and slam
'Nough respect like a sensei, whoop ass like Van Damme
So any nigga that claim they bossin'
What don't you bring your ass on over to Crenshaw and Slauson
Take a walk through the hood, and we up to no good
Slangin''em things like a real O.G. should
I'm stackin' and mackin' and packin' a ten so
When you're slippin', I slip the clip in, but ain't no set-tripppin'
Cause it's Death Row, rollin' like the mafia
Think about whoopin' some ass, but what the fuck stoppin' ya? 
Ain't nothin' but a buster
I'm stranded on death row for pumpin' slugs in motherfuckers
Now you know you're outdone, feel the shotgun
Kurupt: inmate, cell block one
No prevention from this lynchin' of sorts
You're a victim, from my driveby of thoughts
No extensions, all attempts are to fail
Blinded by the light, it's time you learn braille
From the lunatic, I'm death like arsenic
When I kick a wicked rap, Dr. Dre will hit the scratch
With treachery, my literary form will blast
And totally surpass the norm
Not a storm, plural, make it many storms
When I'm vexed, I fly leg necks and arms
In this dimension, I'm the presenter
And the inventor, and the tormentor
Deranged, like the Hillside Strangler
Emcee mangler, tough like Wrangler
I write a rhyme, hard as concrete
Step to the heat and get burned like mesquite
So what you wanna do? 
The narrator RBX, cell block two
Rage: lyrical murderer, stranded on death row
And now I'm serving a lifetime sentence
There'll be no repentance
Since it's the life that I choose to lead, I plead guilty
On all counts, let the ball bounce where it may
I's just another clip into my AK
Buck them down with my underground tactics
Facts and stacks of clips on my mattress
Bed frame, there's another dead, bang
Laying lame put to shame, who's to blame
Me, the Lady of Rage, a woman comin'
From the D-E-A-T-H and R-O-W takin', no shit
So flip and you're bound to get dropped
I's 1-8-7 on motherfuckers, don't stop
Handcuffed as I bust there'll be no debate
I's Rage, from cell block H
Ayo, steppin' through the fog and creepin' through the smog
I's the number one nigga from the hood: Doggy Dogg
Making videos, now I stay in Hollywood
Bustin' raps for my snaps now they call me Eastwood
Dre is the doctor and my homey little nigga
Warren G is my hand and my hand's on the trigga
Shootin' at the hoes with the game that I got
Sent to Death Row cause I wanted to make a grip from serving my rocks
And I'm still serving for mines
Peace, to my motherfucking homies doing time
In the pen and the county jail
Mobbin' with your blues on, mad as hell
And you sayin', 
Fuck the police
And all the homies on the streets is all about peace
And it's driving the cops crazy
But ain't nothin' but a black thing, baby
Uhh, I'm not flaggin', but I'm just saggin'
I bet'cha don't wanna see the D-O-double-G
And you can't see the D-R to the E
Or my motherfuckin' homey D.O.C
You know you can't fuck with my motherfuckin' DJ
That's my homey and we call him Warren G
Yeah, and you don't stop
Doggy Dogg break'em down with the motherfuckin' Dogg Pound
That's the only way we'll beat'em, man
We gotta smoke'em, then choke'em like the motherfucking Peterman
I's like three and to the two and two and to the one
Cell block four, peace, Doggy Dogg's done
Yo, now you know the path I'm on
You think you're strong? 
See if you can travel on
Cause only the weak, will try to speak
Those who are quiet, will always cause riots
There's three types of people in the world:
Those who don't know what happened
Those who wonder what happened
And people like us, from the streets, that make things happen
Cannabis Sativa, or in the heart of LA known as the Chronic
Not to be confused with the Bionic
Even though, it does cost six million dollars
Man, understand? 
Now, we working with some new improved shit on this track
Nevertheless, not no stress, sucker-ass niggas
So now we're gon' move on and uh
Light a big fat one up for the world and hit this
Once or twice and you'll be twice as nice, get it? 
This is the Chronic

Make my bud the Chronic, before I take it home
Make my bud the Chronic, I wants to get fucked up
Make my shit the Chronic, I gots to fire it up
I want the bomb, I want the Chronic
I gots to get fucked up
Make my bud the Chronic, before I take it home
That's fucked up, what they put in this weed? 
That's why they call this shit Chronic
Uh, damn, damn, damn, shit
Fucked up, fucked up, fucked, raises the fuck up
Really, really though
Nah, I'm cooler than a motherfucker
That shit, that shit's, that shit is crazy, man
I'm high, damn
Oh, I'm ready to fuck some shit up now, baby
Oh you can come on and fuck me up
Hm-hm, triple cheeseburger
Oh you talking about some food, I got some...
Some fries, and motherfucking couple of sodas and shit
And hot apple turnovers and all that old shit, nigga
I'm ready to get my munch on
The bud smells good than a motherfucker too
I don't want hit no more of that old shit
That shit is not to be fucked with
Not to be fucked with, I'm high
Oh, nigga, you pass that shit to somebody else
Nigga, I'm through for the night
Really though, really though, nigga
Let's go and get some food, let's get up out this motherfucker
Cause uh, no nigga, don't be trying to pass me that shit
Nigga, I told you I'm cool, oh, I don't want nothing else
I got another dub sack, nigga
Bitches ain't shit but hoes and tricks
Bitches ain't shit but hoes and tricks
Lick on these nuts and suck the dick
Gets the fuck out after you're done
Then I hops in my ride to make a quick run
Bitches ain't shit but hoes and tricks
Lick on these nuts and suck the dick
Gets the fuck out after you're done
Then I hops in my ride to make a quick run
I used to know a bitch named Eric Wright
We used to roll around and fuck the hoes at night
Tighter than a motherfucka with the gangsta beats
And we was balling on the motherfucking Compton streets
Peep, the shit got deep and it was on
Number 1 song after number 1 song
Long as my motherfucking pockets was fat
I didn't give a fuck where the bitch was at
But she was hanging with a white bitch doing the shit she do
Sucking on his dick just to get a buck or two
And the few ends she got didn't mean nothing
Now she's suing cause the shit she be doing ain't shit
Bitch can't hang with the streets, she found herself short
So now she's taking me to court
I's real conversation for your ass
So recognize, and pass to Daz
Now as I'm rolling with my nigga Dre and Eastwood
Fucking hoes, clocking dough, up to no good
We flip-flop and serve hoes like flapjacks
 Bitch, and it's like that
This is what you look for in a ho who got cash flow
You run up in them hoes and grab the cash
And get your dash on
While you're chilling with your homies and shit
And how my niggas kick the anthem like this
Bitches ain't shit but hoes and tricks
Lick on these nuts and suck the dick
Gets the fuck out after you're done
Then I hops in my ride to make a quick run
To the store, to get me a 4-0
Snoop Doggy-Dogg paged, that must mean more hoes
So I head down the street to Long Beach
Just so I could meet a freak
To lick me from my head to my feet
And I'm here, now I'm ready to be done up
Nothing but homies around, so I puts my gun up
Bitches on my nuts like clothes
But I'm from Tha Pound and we don't love them hoes
How could you trust a ho? 
Cause a ho's a trick
We don't love them tricks 
Cause a trick's a bitch
And my dick's constantly in her mouth
Turning them trick-ass hoes the fuck out now
I once had a bitch named Mandy May
Used to be all in them guts like every day
The pussy was the bomb, had a nigga on sprung
I was in love like a motherfucka, licking the pearl tongue
The homies used to tell me that she wasn't no good
But I'm the maniac in black, Mr. Snoop Eastwood
So I figure niggas wouldn't trip with mine
Guess what? Got gaffled by one-time
I'm back to the motherfucking county jail
6 months on my chest, now it's time to bail
I gets released on a hot sunny day
My nigga D.O.C. and my homie Dr. Dre
Scoop in a coupe, 
Snoop we got news
Your girl was tricking while you was draped in your county blues
I ain't been out a second
And already gotta do some motherfucking chin-checkin'
Move up the block as we groove up the block
See my girl's house, 
Dre, pass the Glock
Kick in the do', I look on the flo'
I's my little cousin Daz and he's fucking my ho, yo
I un-cock my shit
I'm heart-broke but I'm still loc'ed
Man, fuck a bitch
Bitches ain't shit but hoes and tricks
Lick on these nuts and suck the dick
Gets the fuck out after you're done
Then I hops in my ride to make a quick run
Bitches ain't shit but hoes and tricks
Lick on these nuts and suck the dick
Gets the fuck out after you're done
Then I hops in my ride to make a quick run
Bitches ain't shit
I don't give a fuck about a bitch
But I and her know that they can't fade this
Cause I'm doin my own thing down with the swang
I'm hanging with Death Row like it ain't no thang
I say you know you can't deal, cause I'm a bitch that's real
Motherfuckers need to step back, hell yeah they need to chill
Because I don't give a fuck, and I don't give a fuck
And I don't give a fuck, I don't give a fuck
And now I gotta do some shit that's clean
But when I'm on a dick, hell yeah, I get real mean, hah
Like a washing machine I can wash the clothes
All the hoes knows that I'm on the flo', ho
But they can't hang with my type of swang
I ain't trying to say I suck every ding-a-lang
But just the juicy ones with the tip of the tongue
And then they're sprung, and with the nuts hung
This is dedicated to the niggas that was down from Day 1

Hey yo Rage, would you please drop some gangsta shit?

Would be the one to make you blink eye
I'm catchy like pink-eye
Never will there ever be another like me
Um, you can play the left, c'ause it ain't no right in me

Smack'em out the park, like A Friendly Game of Baseball
Grand slam, yes, I am
Kickin' up dust and I don't give a goddamn
Cause I'm that lyrical murderer, pleading guilty
You know from my skills I'm about to be–
Filthy, large, Rage in charge
You know what's happenin', don't try to play large
This ain't no rerun, see hon', don't you wanna be one
However, Rage'll wreck ya,'cause I'm def

I'll make'em go coo-coo for my Cocoa
Puffin' stuff, ayo Snoop, you're up
Let these niggas know that niggas don't give a fuck
This is just a small introduction to the G-funk era
Everyday of my life I take a glimpse in the mirror
And I see motherfuckers tryin' to be like me
Ever since I put it down with the D-R-E
Foamin' at the mouth and waggin' his tail
Searchin through the yard with a keen sense of smell
Lookin' for the business in heat
And when he find it he'll be sniffin her seat
We travel in packs and we do it from the back
How else can you get to the booty? 
We do it doggystyle, all the while we do it doggystyle
Yo motherfuckin' hoe! 
He fucked the fleas off a bitch
He shaked the ticks off his dick
And in the booty, he buries his motherfuckin' bone
And if there's any left over
He'll roll over and take a doggy bag home
Damn, that Tanqueray is talkin' to a nigga
I ain't bullshittin, one of y'all niggas gotta get it
Man, I got to piss
Breath test?
 Ha-ha-ha, I'm serious, nigga
One of y'all niggas got some bad motherfuckin' breath
 Aye, baby, aye, baby,  aye, baby
Get some bubblegum in this motherfucker or somethin'
Aye, nigga, get somethin' to eat, dog
Aye, nigga, study long, study wrong, nigga
With so much drama in the L-B-C
I's kind of hard bein' Snoop D-O-double-G
But I, somehow, some way
Keep comin' up with funky-ass shit, like, every single day
May I kick a little something for the G's
And make a few ends as I breeze through? 
Two in the mornin' and the party's still jumpin'
‘Cause my momma ain't home
I got bitches in the livin' room gettin' it on
And they ain't leavin' till six in the mornin'
So what you wanna do? 
Shit, I got a pocket full of rubbers and my homeboys do too
So turn off the lights and close the doors
But  we don't love them hoes, yeah
So we gon' smoke a ounce to this
G's up, hoes down, while you motherfuckers bounce to this
Rollin' down the street, smokin' indo
Sippin' on gin and juice, laid back
With my mind on my money
And my money on my mind
Rollin' down the street, smokin' indo
Sippin' on gin and juice, laid back
With my mind on my money
And my money on my mind
Now that I got me some Seagram's gin
Everybody got they cups, but they ain't chipped in

You got to get yours but, fool, I gotta get mine
Everything is fine when you listening to the D-O-G
I got the cultivating music that be captivating he
Who listens to the words that I speak
As I take me a drink to the middle of the street
And get to mackin' to this bitch named Sadie 
She used to be the homeboy's lady 
80 degrees, when I tell that bitch please
Raise up off these N-U-T's, ‘cause you gets none of these
At ease, as I mob with the Dogg Pound
Feel the breeze beyotch, I'm just…
Rollin' down the street, smokin' indo

With my mind on my money
And my money on my mind

Later on that day, my homie Dr. Dre
Came through with a gang of Tanqueray
And a fat ass J of some bubonic chronic
That made me choke; shit, this ain't no joke
I had to back up off of it and sit my cup down
Tanqueray and chronic, yeah, I'm fucked up now
But it ain't no stoppin', I'm still poppin'
Dre got some bitches from the city of Compton
To serve me; not with a cherry on top
‘Cause when I bust my nut I'm raising up off the cot
Don't get upset, girl, that's just how it goes
I don't love you, hoes, I'm out the door, and I'll be...
Rollin' down the street, smokin' indo
Sippin' on gin and juice, laid back

Just to see you smile and enjoy yourself
Cause it's cool when you cause the cozy conditioning
Which we create, cause that's our mission
So listen close, to what we say
Because this types of shit happens every day
I woke up around 10 o'clock in the morning
I gave myself a strech, up, a morning yawn, and
Went to the bathroom to wash up
I threw some soap on my face and put my hands up on a cup
And said 
Um, mirror mirror, on, the wall
Who is the top dog of them all? 
There was a ruffle duffle, five minutes it lasted
The mirror said, 
You are, you conceited bastard! 
Well that's true! That's why we never have no beef
So I slipped on my khakis and my gold leaf
Used Oil of Olay cause my skin gets pale
And then I got the file, for my fingernails
I'm true to the style on my behalf
I put some bubbles in the tub so I can take a bubble bath
Clean, dry, was my body and hair
I threw on my brand new doggy underwear
For all the bitches I might take home
I got the Johnson's Baby Powder and Cool Water cologne
Now I'm fresh, dressed, like a million bucks
Threw on my white socks, with my all-blue Chucks
Stepped out the house, stopped short, oh no
I went back in, 
I forgot my Indo! 
Then I dilly  I ran through an 
I bumped into this smoker named  from the 
This was a girl playing hard-to-get
So I said 
What's wrong?  cause she looked upset
She said um:
I's all because of you, I'm feeling sad and blue
You went away, now my life is filled with rainy days
I love you so, how much you'll never know
Cause you took your dope away from me
Damn, now what was I to do? 
She's crying over me and she was feelin blue
I said, 
Um, don't cry, dry your eye
And here comes your mother with those two little guys
Her mean mother steps then says to me 
Hi! 
Decked Sally in the face and punched her in the eye
Punched her in the belly and stepped on her feet
Slammed the child on the hard concrete
The bitch was strong, the kids was gone
Something was wrong I said, 
What was goin on? 
I tried to break it up, I said, 
Stop it, just leave her! 
She said, 
If I can't smoke none, she can't either! 
She grabbed me closely by my socks
So I broke the hell out, and I grabbed my sack of rocks
But um, they gave chase, they caught up quick
They started crying on my shoes and grabbin my dick
And saying
Why don't you give me a play
So we can break it down the Long Beach way
And if you give me that okay
I'll give you all my love today
Doggy, Doggy, Doggy, can't you see? 
Somehow your words just hypnotize me
And I just love your jazzy ways
Doggy Dogg, your love is here to stay
And on and on and on she kept going
The bitch been around before my mother born! 
I said 
Cheer up!  and I gave her a hit
I said, 
You can't have me, I'm too young for you bitch! 
She said, 
No you're not!  then she starts cryin
I says I'm 19, she says,

As I look up at the sky
My mind starts tripping
A tear drops my eye
My body temperature falls
I'm shaking and they breaking trying to save the Dogg
Pumping on my chest and I'm screaming
I stop breathing, damn I see demons
Dear God, I wonder can you save me
I can't die my boo boo's bout to have my baby
I think it's too late for praying, hold up
A voice spoke to me and it slowly started saying
How long will I live? 
And will I be the G that I was? 
My eyes are closed
Murder
Murder was the case that they gave me
Murder
Murder was the case that they gave me
I'm fresh up out my coma
I got my Momma and my Daddy and my homies in my corner
I's gonna take a miracle they say
For me to walk again and talk again but anyway
I get fronted some keys to get back on my feet
And everything that nigga said came to reality
Living like a baller loc
Having money and blowing hella chronic smoke
I bought my Momma a Benz, and bought my boo boo a Jag
And now I'm rolling in a nine-trizzay El Do-Rag
Indeed, agreed proceed to smoke weed
Never have a want, never have a need
They say I'm greedy but I still want mo'
Cuz my eyes wanna journey some mo', really doe 
Now I lay me down to sleep
I pray the Lord, my soul to keep
If I should die, before I wake
I pray the Lord, my soul to take
No more indo, gin and juice
I'm on my way to Chino, rolling on the grey goose
Shackled from head to toe
Twenty-five with an izz-el, with nowhere to gizzo, I know
Them niggas from the other side recognize my face
Cause it's the O.G. D-O-double-G, L-B-C
Mad dogging niggas cause I don't care
Red jumpsuit with two braids in my hair
Niggas stare as I enter the center
They send me to a level three yard, that's where I stay
Late night I hear toothbrushes scraping on the floor
Niggas getting they shanks, just in case the war, pops off
Cause you can't tell what's next
My little homie Baby Boo took a pencil in his neck
And he probably won't make it to see twenty-two
I put that on my Momma; I'ma ride for you Baby Boo
Murder
Murder was the case that they gave me
Murder
Murder was the case that they gave me
Six million ways to die, choose one
I's time to escape, but I don't know where the fuck I'm headed
Up or down, right or left, life or death
I see myself in a mist of smoke
Death becomes any nigga that takes me for a joke
We hit a five dollar stick, now we putting in work
Unaccountable amounts of dirt, death becomes all niggas
Anybody killer, you know what the deal is
Nigga, you know what the real is
I see some mark brand niggas on the corner flaggin me down
Sayin, 
Yo Daz, what's up with the Pound? 
Is that nigga Snoop alright? Aiyo what's up with the crew? 
Is them niggas in jail, or are them niggas through? 
I said, 
If you ain't up on thangs
Snoop Dogg is the name, Dogg Pound's the game
I's like this they don't understand
I's an everyday thang, to gangbang
Make that twist, don't be a bitch, let these niggas know
What's up witchu I represent the Pound and Death Row
And can't no other motherfucker in L.A. or Long Beach

I won't leave you until you get the full comprehension
And when you do, that's when the mission
Or survival becomes your every thought
Keep your eyes open'cause you don't wanna be caught
Half stepping with your weapon on safety
Now break yourself motherfucker'fore you make me

Open and release them guts

Brutal, jagged edged, totally ruffneck
Now everybody scream nuff respect to the X

This is DJ EZ Dicc
On W-Balls
Right now something new by Snoop Doggy Dogg
And this one goes out to the ladies from all the guys
A big bow wow wow
Cause we gonna make it a little misty here tonight
This is DJ EZ Dicc
On the station that slaps you across your fat ass
With a fat dick
When I met you last night, baby
Before you opened up your gap
I had respect for you lady
But now I take it all back
Cause you gave me all your pussy
And you even licked my balls
Leave your number on the cabinet
And I promise baby, I'll give you a call
Next time I'm feeling kinda horny
You can come on over
And I'll break you off
And if you can't fuck that day baby
Just lay back and open your mouth
Cause I have never met a girl
That I love in the whole wide world
Well if Kurupt gave a fuck about a bitch I'd always be broke
I'd never have no motherfucking endo to smoke
I gets loc'ed and loony
Bitch you can't do me
Do we look like BBD, you hoochie groupie
I have no love for hoes
That's something that I learned in tha Pound
So how the fuck am I supposed
To pay this ho just to lay this ho
I know the pussy's mine
So I'mma fuck a couple more times
And then I'm through with it
There's nothing else to do with it
Pass it to the homie, now you hit it
Cause she ain't nothing but a bitch to me
And y'all know that bitches ain't shit to me
I gives a fuck
Why don't y'all pay attention
Approach her with a different proposition
I'm Kurupt ho
You'll never be my only one, trick ass bitch
It ain't no fun if the homies can't have none
Guess who back in the motherfucking house
With a fat dick for your motherfucking mouth
Hoes recognize, niggas do too
Cause when bitches get scandalous and pull a voodoo
What you gon' do? 
You really don't know
So I'd advise you not to trust that ho
Silly of me to fall in love with a bitch
Knowing damn well I'm too caught up with my grip
Now as the sun rotates and my game grows bigger
How many bitches wanna fuck this nigga named Snoop
Doggy, I'm all the above
I'm too swift on my toes to get caught up with you hoes
But see it ain't no fun
If my homies can't get a taste of it
Cause you know I don't love em
Hey now you know
Inhale, exhale with my flow
One for the money, two for the bitches
Three to get ready and four to hit the switches
In my Chevy,'64 -- red to be exact
With bitches on my side and bitches on my back
So back up, bitch, because I'm struggling
So get on your knees and then start juggling
These motherfucking nuts in your mouth
I's me, Warren G the nigga with the clout
It ain't no fun if the homies can't have noneCan we get a motherfuckin moment of silence
For this small chronic break? 
A-hah, yeah, niggas be brown-nosing these hoes and shit
Takin' bitches out to eat, and spendin' money on these hoes, Youknowhat
I'msayin? 
I treat a bitch like 7-Up, I never have, I never will
I tell a bitch like this
Bitch, you without me is like Harold Melvin without the Bluenotes;
You'll never go platinum
Hey Daz, give me a light, nigga
Can we get a motherfuckin moment of silence
For the small chronic break? 
A-hah, niggas be brown-nosing these hoes and shit
Taking bitches out to eat, and spending money on these hoes
Know what I'm saying? 
I treat a bitch like 7-Up, I never have I never will
I tell a bitch like this:
Bitch, you without me is like Harold Melvin without Bluenotes
You'll never go platinum! 
Hey Daz, give me a light nigga
We’d like to welcome y'all to the fabulous Carolina West
I own this motherfucker and my name is Taa-Dow
Y'all niggas know who I am, y'all niggas tearin' up shit
But we got somethin' old, and somethin' new for y'all tonight
Put your hands together for Snoop Doggy Dogg
The Dogg Pound, and the fabulous Dramatics
I's like everywhere I lizzook
And everywhere I go
I'm hearing motherfuckers trying to steal my flow
But it ain't no thang, cause, see, my homie Coolio
Put me up on the game when I stepped through the door
Some of these niggas is so deceptive
Using my styles like a contraceptive
I hope you get burnt
Seems you haven't learnt
I's the knick-knack, patty-whack
I still got the biggest sack! 
So put your gun away, run away, cause I'm back
Hit em up, get'em up, spit'em up
Now, tell me, what's going on? 
It make me wanna holler, cause my dollars come in O-zones
Known for break off, shake off, now take off your
Clothes, and quit trying to spit at my motherfuckin' hoes! 
Speaking of hoes, I'll get to the point
You think you got the bomb cause I rolled you a joint? 
You'se a flea, and I'm the Big Dogg
I'll scratch you off my balls with my motherfuckin' paws
Y'alls niggas better recognize
And see where I'm coming from: it's still Eastside
Til I die. Why ask why? 
As the world keeps spinning to the D-O-double G, Y
I's a crazy, mixed-up world
I's a Doggy Dogg World
Well if you give me 10 bitches then I'll fuck all 10
Seen the homie Snoop Doggy sipping juice and gin
Don't slip, I'm for the set-trip, to get papers
Styles vary, packing flavor like Lifesavers
Ain't that something? 
Talk shit and I'm dumping
I had the fuckin' whole block bumpin'
Don't sweat, but check the technique. I'm unique like China
You'll never find a bomber rhymer than this nigga behind ya
So peek-a-boo, clear the way, I'm coming through
1, 2, 3: you can't see me
I'm a G like that, strapped with hit-hard tactics
A fuckin' menace, using hoes like tennis rackets
I's on again, I's on and popping
All I see is green, so there ain't no stopping
I wanna see some panties dropping
I'm coming from L.A
She used to chill with Dre up in Compton
I’m dishin out blues, I’m upsetting like bad news
Cut off khakis, french braids, and house shoes
Kurupt, the name’s often marked for catchin slugs
And I smoke weed for the fuck of it
Ruff and rugged shit, it’s unexplanatory how I gets wicked
But it’s mandatory that I kick it
Check it, I’m runnin hoes in 94, now must I prove it
Hoes call me Sugar Ray for the way I be stickin and movin
Prepare for a war, it’s on, I’m head huntin
Hit the button, and light shit up like Red Dawn
Peep, the massacre from a verbal assassin
Murderin with rhymes packin Tec-9’s for some action
You really don’t know, do you, you fuckin wit a hog
You can’t do me, I’m goin out looney like O-Dog
Tha Dogg Pound rocks the party 
Til when? 
And it don't stop, and it don't quit
For tha Dogg Pound clique to drop the cavi dough
Diggity-Daz out of the motherfuckin' cut once more
So grab a seat and grab your gin and juice and check out the flow
I flip-flop and serve hows with a fat dick
Til I die, I'm still screaming out: bitches ain't shit! 
Now I'm the mack daddy, had he not known about
The city where I'm from: Dum diddy dum
As you groove to the gangster shit
The D-O-double G, the P-O-U-N-D
The gangster clique
Now as the Pound break it down with the gangster funk
I can see and I can tell that's what the fuck you want
Then I blaze up the chronic so I can get high

Let's get ready to rumble! 
Now, you know how we do it, like a G
What really go on in the mind of a nigga
That get down for theirs
Constantly, money over bitches
Not bitches over money
Stay on your grind, nigga
My ambitions as a ridah
My ambitions as a ridah
So many battlefield scars while driven in plush cars
This life as a rap star is nothin' without guard
Was born rough and rugged, addressin' the mass public
My attitude was fuck it,  because motherfuckers love it
To be a soldier, must maintain composure at ease
Though life is complicated, only what you make it to be
Uh, and my ambitions as a ridah
To catch her while she hot and horny, go up inside her
Then I spit some game in her ear, 
Go to the telly, hoe! 
Equipped with money in a Benz ‘cause, bitch, I'm barely broke
I'm smokin' bomb-ass weed, feelin' crucial
From player to player the game's tight, the feeling's mutual
From hustlin' and prayers to breakin' motherfuckers to pay up
I got no time for these bitches, ‘cause these hoes try to play us
I'm on a meal ticket mission, want a mill, so I'm wishin'
Competition got me ripped on that bullshit they stressin'
I'ma rhyme though, clown hoes like it's mandatory
No guts, no glory, my nigga, bitch got the game distorted
Now it's on and it's on because I said so
Can't trust a bitch in the business, so I got with Death Row
Now these money-hungry bitches gettin' suspicious
Started plottin' and plannin' on schemes to come and trick us
But thug niggas be on point and game tight
Me, Syke and Bogart strapped up the same night
Got problems, then handle it, motherfuckers see me
These niggas is jealous
‘Cause deep in they heart they wanna be me
Uh, yeah, and now you got me right beside ya, hopin' you listen
I catch you payin' attention to my ambitions as a ridah
I won't deny it, I'm a straight ridah
You don't wanna fuck with me
Got the police bustin' at me
But they can't do nothin' to a G
Let's get ready to rumble
It was my only wish to rise
Above these jealous coward motherfuckers I despise
When it's time to ride I was the first off this side, give me the 9
I'm ready to die right here tonight and motherfuck they life
That's what they screamin' as they drill me, but I'm hard to kill
So open fire, I see you kill me, witness my steel
Spittin' at adversaries, envious and after me
I'd rather die before they capture me, watch me bleed
Mama, come rescue me, I'm suicidal, thinkin' thoughts
I'm innocent, so there'll be bullets flyin' when I'm caught
 Fuck doin' jail time, better day, sacrificin'
Won't get a chance to do me like they did my nigga Tyson
Thuggin' for life, and if you right, then nigga die for it
Let them other brothers try, at least you tried for it
When it's time to die, to be a man and pick the way you leave
Fuck peace and the police, my ambitions as a ridah
I won't deny it, I'm a straight ridah
You don't wanna fuck with me
Got the police bustin' at me
But they can't do nothin' to a G
Let's get ready to rumble
My murderous lyrics, equipped with spirits of the thugs before me
Pay off the block, evade the cops ‘cause I know they comin' for me
I been hesitant to reappear, been away for years
Now I'm back, my adversaries been reduced to tears
Question my methods to switch up speeds
Sure as some bitches bleed
Niggas'll feel the fire of my mother's corrupted seed
Blast me, but they didn't finish, didn't diminish my powers
So now I'm back to be a motherfuckin' menace, they cowards
That's why they tried to set me up
Had bitch-ass niggas on my team, so indeed they wet me up
But I'm back reincarnated, incarcerated
At the time I contemplate the way that God made it
Lace'em with lyrics that's legendary, musical mercenary
For money I'll have these motherfuckers buried
I been gettin' much mail in jail, niggas tellin' me to kill it
Knowin' when I get out they gon' feel it
Witness the realest! A hoo-ridah when I put the shit inside
The cry from all your people when they find her
Just remind ya, my history'll prove authentic
Revenge on them niggas that played me
And all the cowards that was down with it
Now it's your nigga right beside ya, hopin' you listenin'
Catch you payin' attention to my ambitions as a ridah
I won't deny it, I'm a straight ridah
You don't wanna fuck with me
Got the police bustin' at me
But they can't do nothin' to a G
Let's get ready to rumble
Ah, yeah! Hahaha 
I's all about you, one time! 
Haha, for the bitches that think it's all about you
I's all about you! 
I's all about you
You probably crooked as the last trick
Want to laugh about how I got my ass caught up
With this bad bitch? 
Thinkin' I had her, but she had me in the long run
I's just my luck, I'm stuck with fuckin' with the wrong one
Wise decisions, based on lies we livin'
Scandalous times, this game's like my religion
You could be rollin' with a thug
Instead you with this weak scrub, lookin' for some love
In every club, I see you starin' like you want it
Well, baby, if you got it, better flaunt it
Let the liquor help you get up on it
I'm still tipsy from last night
Bumpin' these walls as I pause, addicted to the fast life
I try to holla, but you tell me you taken
Sayin' you ain't impressed with the money I'm makin'
Guess it's true what they tellin' me
Fresh out of jail, life's hell for a black celebrity
So that's the reason why I call, and maybe you with it
Fantasies of us sweatin', can I hit it? 
Addicted to the things you do
But still true what I'm sayin', boo, ‘cause this is all about you
Every other city we go, every other video
I's all about you
No matter where I go, I see the same ho
Yeah, nigga
Every other city we go, every other video
I's all about you
No matter where I go, I see the same ho
I make a promise if you go with me, just let me know
I'll have you hollerin' my name out before I leave
Nobody loves me, I'm a thug nigga
I only hung out with the criminals and drug dealers
I love niggas, ‘cause we comin' from the same place
Witness me holla at a hoochie
See how quick the game takes
How can I tell her I'm a playa? And I don't even care
Creep low, weed smoke's in the air
Everywhere I go, it's all about the groupie hoes
Waitin' for niggas at the end of every show
I just seen you in my friend's video
Could never put a bitch before my friends, so here we go
Follow the leader and peep the drama that I'm goin' through
I's all about you, yeah, nigga, it's all about you
Every other city we go, every other video
I's all about you
No matter where I go, I see the same ho
Every other city we go, every other video
I's all about you
No matter where I go, I see the same ho
Is you sick from the dick, or is it the flu? 
It ain't about you or your bitch-ass crew
Every other city we go and every video
Explain to a nigga why I see the same shitty ho
You think it's all about you? Well, boo
I gets down like Dru, and my nasty new niggas, too
You couldn't hold me back, it'd take a fatter track
A lyrical attack, perhaps, it was a visual bluff
When I started to snaps all your rode'em swoll
Straight in control, flows'll fold, while hoes cold stroll
Hold the set, I told Dramacy' go in next
Gold diggin', cold diggin' a gold Rolex
I slide in easily, try a grizzly
Sluts know the cuts, I came to fuck, try skeezin' me
Runnin' up in ya just like Bruce Jenner when I bend ya
At the most, I fucked a bitch
From the West Coast to West Virginia
Every other city we go, every other video
I's all about you
No matter where I go, I see the same ho
Every other city we go, every other video
I's all about you
No matter where I go, I see the same ho
Every other city we go, every other video
I's all about you
No matter where I go, I see the same ho
Every other city we go, every other video
No matter where I go, I see the same ho
I'm tellin' ya, it's the same old shit
I mean, goddamn, you know what I'm sayin'? 
I'm sittin' back, watchin' Montell Jordan video
I see the same bitch who was in my homeboy Nate Dogg video, then I flip the channel
I'm checkin' out my homeboy 2Pac video
I see the same bitch that was in my video, you knahmsayin'? 
And then, you nahmsayin', what make that even mo' fucked up, I'm watchin' a Million Man March
And I see the same bitch, on the Million Man March
That was in the homeboy Warren G video
I mean, damn, everywhere I look
Everywhere I go, I see the same ho'
Don't get mad, I'm only bein' real, yeah
Hey Nate, you know you got the vocals on this motherfucker
We finna talk about these scandalous hoes
I can talk about scandalous bitches
I know you can! 
I know you that's why we finna do it
Daz on the beat
Hey Daz, nigga stop fuckin' around with the piano nigga
Just drop that shit like uhh, this here
I met you through my homie now you act like you don't know me
So disappointed'cause baby that shit was so phoney
I's not for me, you see no lovin' from my closest homies
Woulda paid you no mind, but baby you was all up on me
While you proceed with precision, you had the table hosed
No, I ain't mad at you baby, go'head and play them fools
They chose not to listen, so now he stuck inside his house
And can't leave without his bitch permission
The mission's to be a playa, my alias is Boss
Drop a top on these jealous niggas, playa let me floss
Y'all don't wanna see me in pain
I'll leave that ass like Toni Braxton, never breathin' again
I's scandalous, I never liked your back stabbin' ass, triiick
Used to watch you money grabbin', who you baggin' beeyitch? 
Ready to bust, in the city you don't know who to trust
But bitches lookin' scandalous
Scandalous! , she's so scandalous, she's so scandalous
She's so scandalous! , she's so scandalous, she's so scandalous
Scandalous! , she's so scandalous, she's so scandalous
She's so scandalous! , she's so scandalous, she's so scandalous
How's it hangin'?'Cause baby from the back the shit is bangin'
I've been stressing in this ghetto game, trying to do my thang
Won't be no bullshit, no ass-kissin'
This bitch'll have ya wakin' up with all your cash missin'
I'm askin', as if I'm qualified to analyze
You're lookin' at a bitch who specialize in tellin' lies
She got a body make a motherfucker fantasize
Her face ain't never shed a tear through them scandalous eyes
My sister precious in poverty
Plus I knew she was a freak bitch so why should it bother me? 
I'd probably be sprung, addicted to the heat of her tongue
And though I don't where we're goin', she's makin' me come
I've been trained as a boss playa, so what you saying? 
Let me show you, got some hookers we can toss later
Before I let her get me, I got her
Went in her purse took a hundred dollars
Nigga I'm so scandalous
Scandalous! , she's so scandalous, she's so scandalous
She's so scandalous! , she's so scandalous, she's so scandalous
Scandalous! , she's so scandalous, she's so scandalous
She's so scandalous! , she's so scandalous, she's so scandalous
Dangerous and ambitious, while schemin' on gettin' riches
I'm spittin' at tricks'cause I'm addicted to pretty bitches
Currency motivated, not easily terminated
Now that we made it, my niggas can never be faded
This is my prophecy, I gotta be paid
All you cowards that try to stop me is beggin' for early graves
I thought we was cool, I was a fool, thinkin' you could be true
When I don't fuck with your punk crew
These are the tales for my niggas doin' time in the cell
I went from hell, to livin' well
Busting at niggas who said my name in vain
I got no time for them tricks, I'm heavy in the game
I wanna be a baller, please
But the bitches and the liquor keep on calling me
I'm tokin' free on the highway, formulatin' plans
Can't wait til I see L.A.,'cause it's so scandalous
Scandalous! , she's so scandalous, she's so scandalous
She's so scandalous! , she's so scandalous, she's so scandalous
Scandalous! , she's so scandalous, she's so scandalous
She's so scandalous! , she's so scandalous, she's so scandalous
Aiyyo.. how the prettiest bitch be the more scandalous the ho be
You ever peep that shit? 
A bitch can be like 15, fucking with a nigga 35
Gettin' him for everything
Hoes these days is way too motherfucking intelligent
When these niggas get to tricking, hahaha, it's over then
That's aight though
Keep a nigga heavy in the game,'bout so long
Watch them hoes
All you niggas out there
Beware these lying ass scandalous bitches
You find an MC like me, who's strong
Leavin' motherfuckers aborted, with no verbal support
When I command the microphone
I get deadly as Khan, though
With a bear and a snake and a panda, I'm all those
Who can withstand the more power I gain? 
And make it possible, for me
To drop a few to wreck yo' brain
Imagine and keep on wishin' upon a star
Finally realizin' who the fuck we are
When I penetrate, it's been withstandin', faded
Would it be the greatest MC of all-time? 
When I created rhyme
For the simple fact, when I attack I crush your pride
Our intention to ride, every time, all night
I'm faced with the scars beyond this one bar
For me to put down my guard, I'm faced what I'ma ride
Breakin' in gas with the'68 all day
In-and-out with my pay, I'm soon to count the bodies
So mandatory my elevation, my lyrics like orientation
So you can be more familiar with the nigga you facin'
We must be patient, nothin' better than communication
Known to damage and highly flammable, like gas stations
Sorry, I left that ass waitin', no more procrastination
Give up to fate and get that ass shakin'
I'm bustin' and makin' motherfuckers panic
Don't take your life for granted
Put that ass in the dirt, you swear the bitch was planted
My lyrics motivate the planet
I's similar to 
Rhythm Nation, but thugged out
Forgive me, Janet
Who's in control? I'm activatin' your souls
You know the way the games get controlled
Yo, two years ago, a friend of mine
Told me Alize and Cristal blows your mind
Bear witness to the dopest fuckin' rhyme I wrote
Takin' off my coat, clearin' my throat
I got my mind made up, come on
Get in, get into
Let it ride, tonight's the night
I got my mind made up, come on
Get in, get into
Let it ride, tonight's the night
Well, I comes through with two packs
Of the bomb prophylactics
For protection, so my fuckin' sack won't collapse
'Cause nowadays, shit's evadin' the X-rays
Sendin' young motherfuckers to an early grave
I wonder if my terrifyin' tactics of torturin' MCs
Shows my heart's as cold as the tundra
Electrifyin' like thunder, I'm just too much
Rough and raw with that motherfuckin' poisonous touch
I'm an MC with lyrics that's the fuckin' Bombay
You got ten steps before instant death, like Bai Mei
My rhymes'll leave a mark on your mind
As the deadly virus spread through your head, like Sand Palm
There's no escape, nah, I ain't blastin'
I use my mental to assassinate assassins for those askin'
Opposed to laughin', raw maniacal villain
Laughter enhances the chances of the killin'
Why is that?'Cause smilin' faces deceive
You best believe: to MCs, I'm the deadliest disease
My thoughts rip your throat and make it hard to breathe
Your whole camp's under siege, and I'm Jason Voorhees
In the heat of the night is when I defeat and ignite mics
My verbal snipe your vocabs on site
I'm out the cut, uncut and raw with no clause for all
So all my rhymes hit and split the bricks on the wall
You already have an idea about the superior sphere
The greater rhyme creator on both sides of the Equator
I rock from here to there, to Philly and back
To L.A., on the spot where I rock and bust, like straps
As your views get overshadowed when you come in contact
Beware, set and prepare to enter verbal combat
Fuck you losers! 
While you fake jacks, I makes manoeuvres
Like Hitler stickin' up Jews with German Lugers
The mister Meth-Tical from Staten Isle
Will be back after this message, don't touch the dial
Rarely do you see an MC out for justice
Got my gun powder and my musket—blaow! 
Melons get swellings
I paint mental pictures, like Magellan
Half of my clan's repeat felons
Niggas best protect they joints for nine-nickel
Man, I stay on point, like icicles
Now, who wanna test Tical, then touch Tical? 
All up in your motherfuckin' mouth
Headbanger boogie, catch me on tour with Al Doogie
Method Man rolled too tight, you can't pull me
Better take one and pass or that's that ass
Your vital statistics are low and fallin' fast
Johnny Blaze out to get loot, like Johnny Cash
Play a game of Russian Roulette and have a blast
Ayo, lyrical gat spittin' the criminal tactics
Non-believers get my dick and genitals backwards
Let's face it, there's no replacement
Taste this mad underground basement shit I'm laced with
Avalanche on your whole camp when I'm spliffted
Funk Doctor, who? 
Spock, bitch, don't get it twisted
I got connects, like Federal Express
To get the fresh package of bless the dogs can't fetch
Got the clear spot from the rear block
To bust'til every nigga here drop, men I fear not
Hold your nose and blow out'til your ears pop
Since your crew suit you to shift
Now, you claim that your gears locked
Whiff this underground cannabis
I'm dangerous, like John the Bomb Analyst
Flip MCs like kis
My degrees freeze consecutively, like EPMD LPs
Lick off a shot and hit your fam by mistake
So I erase the whole front row at the wake
I planned my escape in case Jake wanna snake
Bust it, I'm the one pushin' the hearse, in the first place
Confidence for you shaky-ass folks
Pump for Rockafella for the day he got smoked
Choke off this antidote, got you ope
Get roast by my lyrical Billy Dee.45 Colt
I-N-S the Rebel
How do you want it? 
How do you feel? 
Comin' up as a nigga in the cash game
Livin' in the fast lane, I'm for real
How do you want it yeah? 
How do you feel? 
Comin' up as a nigga in the cash game
Livin' in the fast lane, I'm for real
I love the way you activate your hips and push your ass out
Got a nigga wantin' it so bad, I'm about to pass out
Wanna dig you, and I can't even lie about it
Baby, just alleviate your clothes, time to fly up out it
Catch you at a club, oh shit, you got me fiendin'
Body talkin' shit to me, but I can't comprehend the meanin'
Now, if you wanna roll with me, then here's your chance
Doin' eighty on the freeway, police, catch me if you can
Forgive me, I'm a rider, still I'm just a simple man
All I want is money, fuck the fame, I'm a simple man
Mr. International, player with the passport
Just like Aladdin, bitch, get you anything you ask for
I's either him or me; Champagne, Hennessy
A favorite of my homies when we floss on our enemies
Witness as we creep to a low speed, peep what a ho need
Puff some mo' weed, funk, ya don't need
Approachin' hoochies with a passion, been a long day
But I've been driven by attraction in a strong way
Your body is bangin', baby, I love it when you flaunt it
Time to give it to daddy, nigga, now tell me how you want it
How do you want it? 
How does it feel? 
Comin' up as a nigga in the cash game
Livin' in the fast lane, I'm for real
How do you want it? 
How do you feel? 
Comin' up as a nigga in the cash game
Livin' in the fast lane, I'm for real
Tell me is it cool to fuck? 
Did you think I come to talk? Am I a fool or what? 
Positions on the floor, it's like erotic
Ironic,'cause I'm somewhat psychotic
I'm hittin' switches on bitches
Like I been fixed with hydraulics
Up and down like a roller coaster
I'm up inside ya, I ain't quittin''til the show is over
'Cause I'm a rider, in and out just like a robbery
I'll probably be a freak and let you get on top of me
Get her rockin' these, nights full of Alize
A livin' legend you ain't heard about
These niggas play these Cali days
C. Delores Tucker, you's a motherfucker
Instead of tryin' to help a nigga, you destroy a brother
Worse than the others; Bill Clinton, Mister Bob Dole
You're too old to understand the way the game's told
You're lame so I gotta hit you with the hot facts
Once I'm released, I'm makin' millions, nigga, top that
They wanna censor me; they'd rather see me in a cell
Livin' in hell, only a few of us'll live to tell
Now everybody talkin' about us, I could give a fuck
I'd be the first one to bomb and cuss
Nigga, tell me how you want it
How do you want it? 
How do you  feel? 
Comin' up as a nigga in the cash game
Livin' in the fast lane, I'm for real
How do you want it? 
How do you  feel? 
Comin' up as a nigga in the cash game
Livin' in the fast lane, I'm for real
Raised as a youth, tell the truth
I got the scoop on how to get a bulletproof
Because I jumped from the roof before I was a teenager
Mobile phone, Skypager, game rules, I'm livin' major
My adversaries is lookin' worried
They paranoid of gettin' buried
One of us gon' see the cemetery
My only hope to survive if I wish to stay alive
Gettin' high, see the demons in my eyes, before I die
I wanna live my life and ball, make a couple million
And then I'm chillin', fade'em all
These taxes got me crossed up and people tryin' to sue me
Media is in my business and they actin' like they know me
But I'ma mash out and peel out
I’m with a clique that’s quick to whip that fuckin' steel out
Yeah nigga, it's some new shit so better get up on it
When you see me, tell a nigga how you want it
How do you want it? 
How do you want it? 
How do you feel? 
Comin' up as a nigga in the cash game
Livin' in the fast lane, I'm for real
How do you want it? 
How do you feel? 
Comin' up as a nigga in the cash game
Livin' in the fast lane, I'm for real
How do you want it? 
How do you feel? 
Comin' up as a nigga in the cash game
Livin' in the fast lane, I'm for real
How do you want it? 
How do you feel? 
Comin' up as a nigga in the cash game
Livin' in the fast lane, I'm for real
Me and my Nigga Johnny J...yeah we out
How do you want it? 
How do you feel? 
Comin' up as a nigga in the cash game
Livin' in the fast lane, I'm for real
How do you want it? 
How do you feel? 
Comin' up as a nigga in the cash game
Livin' in the fast lane, I'm for real
How do you want it? 
How do you feel? 
Comin' up as a nigga in the cash game
Livin' in the fast lane, I'm for real
Up out of there
Ain't nothin' but a gangsta party
Eh, light that up, Snoop! Why you actin like that? 
Ahh shit, you done fucked up now
You done put two of America's most wanted in the same motherfuckin' place at the same motherfuckin' time
Y'all niggas about to feel this
Break out the Champagne glasses and the motherfuckin' condoms, have one on us, a'ight? 
A toast to the gangsters
Picture perfect, I paint a perfect picture
Bomb the hoochies with precision
My intention's to get richer
With the S-N double-O-P, Dogg, my fuckin' homie
You's a cold-ass nigga on them hogs
Sho'nuff, I keep my hand on my gun
'Cause they got me on the run
Now I'm back in the courtroom, waitin' on the outcome
Free 2Pac is all that's on a nigga's mind
But at the same time, it seems they tryin' to take mine
So I'ma get smart and get defensive and shit
And put together a Million March for some gangsta shit
So now they got us laced
Two multi-millionaire motherfuckers catchin' cases
Bitches get ready for the throw down
The shit's about to go down
Me and Snoop about to clown
I'm losin' my religion
I'm vicious on these stool pigeons
You might be deep in this game
But you got the rules missin'
Niggas be actin' like they savage
They out to get the cabbage
I've got nothin' but love for my niggas livin' lavish
I've got a pit named Petey, she Nigerina
I've got a house out in the hills right next to Chino
And I think I've got a black Beamer
But my dream's to own a fly casino
Like Bugsy Siegel, and do it all legal
And get scooped up by the little homie in the Regal
It feels good to you, baby-bubba
You see, this is for the G's and the keys, motherfucker
Now follow as we ride
Motherfuck the rest, two of the best from the Westside
And I can make you famous
Niggas been dyin' for years, so how could they blame us? 
I live in fear of a felony
I never stop bailin' these motherfuckin' G's
If you got it, better flaunt it
Another warrant for two of America's most wanted
Ain't nothin' but a gangsta party
Ain't nothin' but a gangsta party
Ain't nothin' but a gangsta party
Ain't nothin' but a gangsta party
Ain't nothin' but a gangsta party
Now give me fifty feet
Defeat is not my destiny, release me to the streets
And keep whatever's left of me
Jealousy is misery, sufferin' is greed
Better be prepared when you cowards fuck with me
I bust and flee, these niggas must be crazy, what? 
There ain't no mercy
Motherfuckers who can't fade the thugs
You thought it was, but it wasn't, now disappear
Bow down in the presence of a boss player
I's like Cuz/Blood gang-bangin'
Everybody in the party doin' dope-slangin'
You gotta have papers in this world
You might get your first snatch before your eyes swirl
You doin' your job every day
And then you work so hard'til your hair turns gray
Let me tell you about life and about the way it is
You see, we live by the gun, so we die by the guns, kids
They tell me not to roll with my Glock
So now I got a throw-away
Floatin' in the black Benz, tryin' to do a show a day
They wonder how I live with five shots
Niggas is hard to kill on my block
Schemes for currency and dough-related
Affiliated with the hustlers, so we made it
No answers to questions, I'm tryin' to get up on it
My nigga Dogg with me, eternally the most wanted
Ain't nothin' but a gangsta party
Ain't nothin' but a gangsta party
Ain't nothin' but a gangsta party
Ain't nothin' but a gangsta party
Ain't nothin' but a gangsta party
Ain't nothin' but a gangsta party
Ain't nothin' but a gangsta party
Ain't nothin' but a gangsta party
Biatch! Where you at? Where you at? 
Ain't nothin' but a gangsta party
Yeah, Death Row
Hey De
Vante
Nigga, don'tcha know we're gonna sow up every bitch in the country
Me and you, up in the same motherfuckin' room
On the same level
This shit here, hahahaha
Please, no more pain
That's right nigga
Hey drop that shit boy
My adversaries cry like hoes fully eradicate my foes
My lyrics explode on contact, gamin' you hoes
Who else but Mama's only son, fuck the phony niggas I'm the one
Say my name, watch bitches come
Now fire when ready, stay watchin' our figure
Increase speed, make you motherfuckers bleed from your mouth quicker
Plus all these niggas that you run with, be on some dumb shit
Trickin' on hoes, I ain't the one bitch
Holla my name and witness game official, it's so sick
Have every single bitch that came witchu, on my dick
Plus this alcohol increases the chance to be deceased
I'm movin' you stupid bitches, vicious telekinesis
Am I reachin' your brain? Nigga how can I explain? 
How vicious this Thug motherfucker came
When I die, I want to be a living legend, say my name
Affiliated with this motherfuckin' game, with no more pain
I came to bring the pain, hardcore to the brain
Let's go inside my astral plane 
I came to bring the pain, hardcore to the brain
Let's go inside my astral plane 
I came to bring the pain, hardcore to the brain
Let's go inside my astral plane 
I came to bring the pain, hardcore to the brain
Let's go inside my astral plane 
Line up my adversaries, blast on sight
And fuck your boyfriend bitch, I want some ass tonight You know my steelo, Alize and Cristal, weed
Sure you heard of all the freaky shit they say about me, huh
Plus all you busters is jealous, pull your gun out and blast
I dare you niggas to open fire, I'll murder that ass
And disappear before the, cops come runnin'
My Glock's spittin' rounds, niggas fallin' down clutchin' they stomach
I's Westside, Death Row, Thug niggas on the rise
Busters shot me five times, real niggas don't die
Can ya hear me? , laced with this game, I know you fear me
Spit the secret to war, so cowards fear me
My only fear of death is reincarnation
Heart of a solider with a brain to teach your whole nation
And feelin' no more pain
I came to bring the pain, hardcore to the brain
Let's go inside my astral plane 
I came to bring the pain, hardcore to the brain
Let's go inside my astral plane 
I came to bring the pain, hardcore to the brain 
Let's go inside my astral plane 
I came to bring the pain, hardcore to the brain
Let's go inside my astral plane 
I came to bring the pain, hardcore to the brain 
Let's go inside my astral plane 
Bury me that's what they all say
I's time to make a killin', sure to make a million with De
Vante
Bitch I know you want me, what your mouth say? , now, watch your eyes
You don't wanna get with me, that's a lie
I got my hands on your hips, no time to bullshit
Freaky bitch, come give me kiss
Tell them niggas from other areas, brothers from here
So obsessed with this money makin' it ain't nothin' we fear
Now they label me a troublemaker, cause I'm a ridah
Death to you playa haters, don't let me find ya
Mama made me rugged, Baptize the public
Now you all thugs, nigga don't you love it
I's similar to multiple gunshots, retaliation is a must
Wasn't too sure what you facin' so watch the guns bust
You niggas'll bleed, fuckin' with me you'll be deceased

Last year we was lettin' these niggas kick up dust
This year you motherfuckers gonna be dust
Thug Life nigga Westsiiide!
Hey, Suge, what I tell you, nigga?

I was gonna start diggin' into these niggas' chest, right? 
Heh, watch this! 
Hey, Quik, let me see them binoculars, nigga, the binoculars! 
Hahahahaha! Yeah, nigga, time to ride! 
Grab your bulletproof vest, nigga
'Cause it's gonna be a long one
Now, me and Quik finna show you niggas what it's like on this side—the real side
Now, on this ride there's gonna be some real motherfuckers
And there's gonna be some pussies
Now, the real niggas gonna be the ones with money and bitches
The pussies gonna be the niggas on the floor bleedin'
Now, everybody keep your eyes on the prize
'Cause the ride get tricky
See, you got some niggas on your side that say they're your friends, but, in real life they your enemies
And then you got some motherfuckers that say they your enemies
But in real life they eyes is on your money
See, the enemies will say they true
But in real life those niggas will be snitches
I's a dirty game, y'all
Y'all gotta be careful about who you fuck with and who you don't fuck with,'cause the shit get wild, y'all
Keep your mind on your riches, baby! 
Keep your mind on your riches! 
9-1-1, it's an emergency, cowards tried to murder me
From hood to the'burbs, everyone of you niggas heard of me
Shit, I'm legendary, niggas scaried and paralyzed
Nothin' more I despise than a liar, cowards die
My mama told me when I was a seed
Just a vicious motherfucker, why these devils left me free? 
I proceed to make'em shiver when I deliver
Criminal lyrics from a worldwide mob figure
Thug niggas from everywhere, Mr. Makaveli
Niggas is waitin' for some thug shit, that's what they tell me
So many rumors, but I'm infinite, Immortal Outlaw
Switchin' up on you ordinary bitches like a southpaw: you get left
And every breath I breathe until the moment I'm deceased
Will be another moment ballin' as a G
I rip the crowd, then I start again, eternally, I live in sin
Until the moment that they let me breathe again; the hearts of men
The hearts of men
My lyrical verge with so much pain, to some niggas it hurts
My guns bust, if you ain't one of us it gets worse
Bitch niggas get their eyes swoll in fly mode
I'm a homicidal outlaw, and five-o
Get your lights on, the fight's on
Tonight's gonna be a fuckin' fight so we might roll
My own homies say I'm heartless
But I'm a G to this until the day I'm gone, that's regardless
Ride by, niggas bow down, thought I'd rot in jail
Paid bail, well, a nigga's out now
Throw up your hands if you thugged out
First nigga act up, first nigga gettin' drugged out
I can be a villain if you let me
A motherfucker if you do upset me
Tell the cops to come and get me
Rip the crowd like a phone number, then start again
Don't have no motherfuckin' friends
Nigga, look inside the hearts of men
In the hearts of men
To all my niggas engaged in makin' money in the fifty states
Keep your mind on your chips and fuck a punk bitch
No longer livin' in fear, my pistol close in hand
Convinced that this is my year like I'm the chosen man
Give me my money and label me as a don
If niggas is havin' problems, smoke'em, fire and bomb
I died and came back, I hustle with these lyrics
As if it's a game of crack, thuggin' is in my spirit
I'm lost and not knowin'
Scarred up but still flowin', energized and still goin'
Uhh, can it be fate, that makes a sick motherfucker break
On these jealous-ass cowards'cause they evil and fake? 
What will it take? Give me that bass line, I'm feelin' bomb
Death Row, baby, don't be alarmed
The homie Quik gave a nigga a beat and let me start again
Represent,'cause I've been sent, the hearts of men
How many brothers fell victim to the streets? 
Rest in peace, young nigga, there's a heaven for a G
Be a lie If I told you that I never thought of death
My niggas, we the last ones left, but life goes on
How many brothers fell victim to the streets? 
Rest in peace, young nigga, there's a heaven for a G
Be a lie If I told you that I never thought of death
My niggas, we the last ones left, but life goes on
As I bail through the empty halls, breath stinkin' in my jaws
Ring, ring, ring — quiet, y'all, incomin' call
Plus this my homie from high school, he gettin' by
I's time to bury another brother, nobody cry
Life as a baller: alcohol and booty calls
We used to do'em as adolescents, do you recall? 
Raised as G's, loc'ed out, and blazed the weed
Get on the roof, let's get smoked out, and blaze with me
Two in the morning and we still high, assed out
Screamin', 
Thug'til I die!  before I passed out
But now that you're gone, I'm in the zone
Thinkin' I don't wanna die all alone, but now you gone
And all I got left are stinkin' memories
I love them niggas to death, I'm drinkin' Hennessy
While tryin' to make it last
I drank a fifth for that ass when you passed,'cause life goes on
How many brothers fell victim to the streets? 
Rest in peace, young nigga, there's a heaven for a G
Be a lie If I told you that I never thought of death
My niggas, we the last ones left, but life goes on
How many brothers fell victim to the streets? 
Rest in peace, young nigga, there's a heaven for a G
Be a lie If I told you that I never thought of death
My niggas, we the last ones left, but life goes on
Yeah nigga, I got the word it's hell
You blew trial and the judge gave you 25 with an L
Time to prepare to do fed time, won't see parole
Imagine life as a convict that's gettin' old
Plus with the drama, we're lookin' out for your baby's mama
Takin' risks, while keepin' cheap tricks from gettin' on her
Life in the hood is all good for nobody
Remember gamin' on dumb hotties at yo' party
Me and you, no truer two, while schemin' on hits
And gettin' tricks that maybe we can slide into
But now you buried — rest, nigga,'cause I ain't worried
Eyes blurry, sayin' goodbye at the cemetery
Though memories fade
I got your name tatted on my arm so we both ball'til my dyin' days
Before I say goodbye
Kato and Mental, rest in peace! Thug'til I die! 
How many brothers fell victim to the streets? 
Rest in peace, young nigga, there's a heaven for a G
Be a lie If I told you that I never thought of death
My niggas, we the last ones left, but life goes on
How many brothers fell victim to the streets? 
Rest in peace, young nigga, there's a heaven for a G
Be a lie If I told you that I never thought of death
My niggas, we the last ones left, but life goes on
Bury me smilin' with G's in my pocket
Have a party at my funeral, let every rapper rock it
Let the hoes that I used to know
From way befo' kiss me from my head to my toe
Give me a paper and a pen, so I can write about my life of sin
A couple bottles of gin, in case I don't get in
Tell all my people I'm a Ridah
Nobody cries when we die, we Outlawz, let me ride
Until I get free
I live my life in the fast lane, got police chasin' me
To my niggas from old blocks, from old crews
Niggas that guided me through back in the old school
Pour out some liquor, have a toast for the homies
See, we both gotta die, but you chose to go before me
And brothers miss you while you gone
You left your nigga on his own; how long we mourn? Life goes on
Life goes on, homie
Gone on,'cause they passed away
Niggas doin' life
Niggas doin' 50 and 60 years and shit
I feel you, nigga! Trust me, I feel you
You know what I mean? 
Last year we poured out liquor for ya
This year, nigga, life goes on
We're gonna clock now
Get money, evade bitches, evade tricks
Give playa haters plenty of space
And basically just represent for you, baby
Next time you see your niggas, we gon' be on top, nigga
You gon' be like, 
Goddamn, them niggas came up! 
That's right, baby, life goes on
And we up out this bitch
Hey, Kato! Mental! 
Y'all niggas make sure it's poppin'
When we get up there, man, don't front
Life goes on
Hold me no more, hold me no more
Yes it do, yes it do, yes it do
Only God can judge me 
Only God can judge me now
Nobody else 
All you other motherfuckers get out my business 
Only God can judge me now
Perhaps I was blind to the facts, stabbed in the back
I couldn't trust my own homies, just a bunch of dirty rats
Will I succeed? Paranoid from the weed
And hocus pocus, I try to focus, but I can't see
And in my mind I'm a blind man doin' time
Look to my future, ‘cause my past is all behind me
Is it a crime to fight for what is mine? 
Everybody's dyin', tell me what's the use of tryin'
I've been trapped since birth, cautious ‘cause I'm cursed
And fantasies of my family in a hearse
And they say it's the White man I should fear
But it's my own kind doin' all the killin' here
I can't lie, ain't no love for the other side
Jealousy inside, make'em wish I died
Oh my Lord, tell me what I'm livin' for
Everybody's droppin', got me knockin' on Heaven's door
And all my memories of seein' brothers bleed
And everybody grieves, but still nobody sees
Recollect your thoughts, don't get caught up in the mix
‘Cause the media is full of dirty tricks
Only God can judge me
Only God can judge me, only God
Only God can judge me
Only God can judge me
Only God can judge me, only God
Only God can judge me now
Only God can judge me, only God
Only God can judge me
Only God can judge me, only God
Only God can judge me
I hear the doctor standin' over me, screamin' I can make it
Got a body full of bullet holes, layin' here naked
Still I can't breathe, something's evil in my IV
‘Cause everytime I breathe I think they killin' me
I'm havin' nightmares, homicidal fantasies
I wake up stranglin', dangled in my bed sheets
I call the nurse ‘cause it hurts to reminisce
How did it come to this? I wish they didn't miss
Somebody help me, tell me where to go from here
‘Cause even thugs cry, but do the Lord care? 
Try to remember but it hurts
I'm walkin' through the cemetery, talkin' to the dirt
I'd rather die like a man than live like a coward
There's a ghetto up in Heaven and it's ours
Black Power!  is what we scream
As we dream in a paranoid state
And our fate is a lifetime of hate
Dear Mama, can you save me? And fuck peace
‘Cause the streets got our babies, we gotta eat
No more hesitation, each and every black male's trapped
And they wonder why we suicidal running'round strapped
Mr. Police, please try to see
That there's a million motherfuckers stressin' just like me
Only God can judge me
Only God can judge me, only God
Only God can judge me
Only God can judge me
Only God can judge me, only God
Only God can judge me now
Only God can judge me, only God
Only God can judge me
Only God can judge me, only God
Only God can judge me
That which does not kill me can only make me stronger
That's for real
And I don't see why everybody feel as though
That they gotta tell me how to live my life
You know? 
Let me live, baby, let me live
Pac, I feel ya, keep servin' it on the reala
For instance, say a playa-hatin' mark is out to kill ya
Would you be wrong for buckin' a nigga to the pavement? 
He gon' get me first, if I don't get him fool start prayin'
Ain't no such thing as self-defense in the court of law
So judge us when we get to where we're goin wearin' a cross
That's real, got him, lurked him, crept the fuck up on him
Sold a half a million tapes, now everybody want him
After talkin' behind my back like a bitch would
Tellin' them niggas, 
You can fade him
Punk, I wish you would
It be them same motherfuckers in your face
That'll rush up in your place to get your safe
Knowin' you on that paper chase
Grass, glass, big screen and leather couch
My new shit is so fetti, already sold a ki or ounce
Bitch, remember 2Pac and 4-Tay
The same two brothers dodgin' bullets, representin' the Bay
Pac, when you was locked down
That's when I'll be around
Start climbin' up the charts, so sick, but they tried to clown
That's why they ride the bandwagon
Still be draggin', sellin' lies
Don't think I don't see you haters, I know y'all in disguise
Guess you figure you know me, ‘cause I'm a thug
That love to hit the late night club drink and buzzed
Been livin' lavish like a player all day
Now I'm bout to floss'em off, player shit with 4-Tay
Only God can judge me
Only God can judge me, only God
Only God can judge me
Only God can judge me
Only God can judge me, only God
Only God can judge me now
Only God can judge me, only God
Only God can judge me
Only God can judge me, only God
Only God can judge me
Only God man
That right? 
That’s real
Hahahahahaha
Fuck everybody else, you know what I’m sayin'? 
Man, look here, man
My only fear of death
Is comin' back to this bitch reincarnated, man
That’s for the homie mental
Hehehehe
We up out
A military mind, nigga
A military mind mean money
A criminal grind, nigga
A criminal grind mean hustle
You know
We tradin' war stories, we Outlawz on the rise
Jealous niggas I despise, look in my eyes
We tradin' war stories, we Outlawz on the rise
Jealous niggas I despise, look in my eyes
Now can your mind picture, a thug nigga drinkin' hard liquor
This ghetto life has got me catchin' up to God quicker
Who would figure that all I need was a hair trigger
Semi-automatic MAC-11 just to scare niggas
Pardon my thug poetry, but suckers is born everyday
And feared men grow on trees
Criminal ties for centuries, a legend in my own rhymes
So niggas whisper when they mention
Machiavelli was my tutor Donald Goines, my father figure
Mama sent me to go play with the drug dealers
Henceforth, we thug niggas and we came in packs
Every one of niggas strapped sippin' on ‘yak
In the back, my AR-15
Thuggin''til I die, these streets got me cravin' thorazine
My lyrics are blueprints to money makin'
Fat as that ass that honey shakin'
My nigga tradin' war stories, we Outlawz on the rise
Jealous niggas I despise, look in my eyes
My nigga tradin' war stories, we Outlawz on the rise
Jealous niggas despise, look in my eyes
I bust a trey-trey, buggin an' shit
They call it overthuggin' and shit
But I was just a younger nigga;
Gettin' older and lovin' this shit
But what was I doin' in this place? 
To the fakes without a pistol in the first
Facin' termination in the worst
But I figured to play the wall; to watch all
These playa hatin' niggas position for I could see'em all
Made it up out of there, lucky to be here to tell you
But it'll never be a repeat people I'm tryna tell you
Now picture the scenery, I'm thugged out smokin' greenery
Considered a B.G., but I'm off in this game something D-P
My eyes only see deez, that's why I'm young and burnt out
Learned the know how, well how to do now, by 18 turned out
And wide open - the ridin' and smokin'
Collidin' with foes - in the worst place;
Y'all shouldn'ta fucked with us, in the first place
Y'all real O.G.'s, droppin' game to the youngsters
Y'all don't want no funk cause
Y'all be the next in the long line of war stories
We tradin' war stories, we Outlawz on the rise
Jealous niggas I despise, look in my eyes
We tradin' war stories, we Outlawz on the rise
Jealous niggas I despise, look in my eyes
I breaks them off with this gangsta war story tale
Stacking loot up in the coupe that I protect with a Mack 12
Slap my clip in the chamber; fool, your life's in danger
No one will remain when I come through dumping insane
Call me Bo Loc Major Pain, gun-slang and moving'caine
I be the nigga that's pulling the trigger and dumping the hot ones up in your brain
More bigger balls than Ru
Paul, Thug Life ain't a ball
We bust that ass up against the wall 
Never been no sign for men call
How we bucks them down on the way to the ground
Ain't nothing but the hog in me
Plus, stompin' steel toed, killin' up hoes and keep mobbin' G
It ain't no calling the funk off
Don't be funking with my sawed off
Bust they dirty-ass drawers off
And had them bitch niggas hauled off
We tradin' war stories, we Outlawz on the rise
Jealous niggas I despise, look in my eyes
We tradin' war stories, we Outlawz on the rise
Jealous niggas I despise, look in my eyes
My whole family been raised, on shit that ain't okay
Ain't nothing on this earth will make a nigga like me stay
I'm reminiscing, and catchin' flashbacks when niggas ran up
In my house and I was too young, to try to blast back
What happend then? No one would tell me since I was three
Heard that God took my peoples, now they living somewhere free
But fuck that, you got what's mines and I want that
Never drop my guard, been on the squad, since ways back
And now I'm sitting, holding in anger because my parents missing
Thugging Immortal when got some war stories for you
Now look at me - straight Outlaw Immortal
Never gave a fuck cause I was nobody's daughter
Outlawing from my tits to my clits, don't try to figure
Cause the murderous tendencies in my mind, can't be controlled, nigga
So who's the bigger, who's the quickest killer? 
Would you try to trip with my finger on the 9 milla
When I got you on kay-nine-fourths
Prayin' to God as your life goes back and forth
We tradin' war stories
We tradin' war stories, Outlawz on the rise
Jealous niggas I despise, look in my eyes
We tradin' war stories, Outlawz on the rise
Jealous niggas I despise, look in my eyes
We tradin' war stories, Outlawz on the rise
Jealous niggas I despise, look in my eyes
We tradin' war stories, Outlawz on the rise
Jealous niggas I despise, look in my eyes

War stories nigga; hahaha, what players do
Thug Life, Outlaw Immortalz
Motherfucking 2Pac a.k.a. Makaveli
Can you feel me? 
Just so you know, it's on Death Row
My niggas love that shit
Dramacydal in this motherfucker, heheheh
Yea nigga! Shout out to my niggas Fatal N Felony
C-Bo, the bald head nut, what? 
You know what time it is
California love
California knows how to party
California knows how to party
In the city of L.A.
In the city of good ol' Watts
In the city, the city of Compton
We keep it rockin', we keep it rockin'
Now let me welcome everybody to the Wild Wild West
A state that's untouchable like Eliot Ness
The track hits your eardrum like a slug to your chest
Pack a vest for your Jimmy in the city of sex
We in that sunshine state where the bomb-ass hemp be
The state where you never find a dance floor empty
And pimps be on a mission for them greens
Lean mean money-making-machines servin' fiends
I been in the game for 10 years makin' rap tunes
Ever since honeys was wearin' Sassoon
Now it's'95 and they clock me and watch me
Diamonds shinin', lookin' like I robbed Liberace
I's all good, from Diego to the Bay
Your city is the bomb if your city makin' pay
Throw up a finger if you feel the same way
Dre puttin' it down for Californ-i-a
California knows how to party
California knows how to party 
In the city of L.A.
In the city of good ol' Watts
In the city, the city of Compton
We keep it rockin'
Shake, shake it, baby
Shake, shake it, mama
Shake it, Cali
Shake it, shake it, baby
Shake it, shake it, shake it, shake it
Out on bail, fresh out of jail, California dreamin'
Soon as I step on the scene, I'm hearin' hoochies screamin'
Fiendin' for money and alcohol, the life of a Westside player
Where cowards die and the strong ball
Only in Cali where we riot, not rally, to live and die
In L.A. we wearin' Chucks, not Ballys 
Dressed in Locs and Khaki suits, and ride is what we do
Flossin' but have caution: we collide with other crews
Famous because we program
Worldwide, let them recognize from Long Beach to Rosecrans
Bumpin' and grindin' like a slow jam
I's Westside, so you know the Row won't bow down to no man
Say what you say, but give me that bomb beat from Dre
Let me serenade the streets of L.A.
From Oakland to Sac-town, the Bay Area and back down
Cali is where they put their mack down; give me love! 
California knows how to party
California knows how to party 
In the city of L.A.
In the city of good ol' Watts
In the city, the city of Compton
We keep it rockin'
 South Central
 Uh, that's right
 Now make it shake
 Shake, shake it, baby
Shake, shake it, mama
Shake it, Cali
Shake it, shake it, baby
Shake it, shake it, shake it, shake it
Shake it, Cali
Uh, uh, West Coast
Uh, yeah, uh, uh, Long Beach in the house
Uh, yeah, Oaktown
Oakland definitely in the house
Frisco, Frisco
And you know L.A. up in here
Pasadena, where you at? 
Yeah, Inglewood
Inglewood always up to no good
Even Hollywood tryin' to get a piece, baby
Sacramento, Sacramento where you at? 
Throw it up, y'all! Throw it up, throw it up! 
I can't see ya
Let's show these fools how we do it over on this Westside
'Cause you and I know it's the best side
Yeah, that's right
West Coast, west Coast
Change, shit, I guess change is good for any of us
Whatever it take for any of y'all niggas
To get up out the hood
Shit, I'm wit'cha, I ain't mad at cha
Got nothin' but love for ya, do your thing, boy
Yeah, all the homies that I ain't talk to in a while
I'ma send this one out for y'all
Know what I mean?'Cause I ain't mad at cha
Heard y'all tearin' up shit out there
Kickin' up dust, givin' a motherfuck
Yeah, niggas,'cause I ain't mad at cha
Now we was once two niggas of the same kind
Quick to holla at a hoochie with the same line
You was just a little smaller, but you still rolled
Got stretched to Y.A. and hit the hood swoll
'Member when you had a Jheri Curl, didn't quite learn
On the block, wit'cha Glock, trippin' off sherm
Collect calls to the crib, sayin' how you've changed
Oh you a Muslim now? No more dope game
Heard you might be comin' home, just got bail
Wanna go to the mosque, don't wanna chase tail
It seems I lost my little homie, he's a changed man
Hit the pen and now no sinnin' is the game plan
When I talk about money all you see is the struggle
When I tell you I'm livin' large you tell me it's trouble
Congratulations on the weddin', I hope your wife know
She got a playa for life, and that's no bullshittin'
I know we grew apart, you probably don't remember
I used to fiend for your sister, but never went up in her
And I can see us after school, we'd bomb
On the first motherfucker with the wrong shit on
Now the whole shit's changed and we don't even kick it
Got a big money scheme and you ain't even with it
Knew in my heart you was the same motherfucker that
Go toe to toe when it's time to roll, you got a brother's back
And I can't even trip,'cause I'm just laughin' at cha
You tryin' hard to maintain, then go ahead,'cause I ain't mad at cha
I ain't mad at cha
I ain't mad at cha
I ain't mad at cha
We used to be like distant cousins, fightin', playin' dozens
Whole neighborhood buzzin', knowin' that we wasn't
Used to catch us on the roof or behind the stairs
I'm gettin' blitzed and I reminisce on all the times we shared
Besides bumpin' and grindin', wasn't nothin' on our mind
In time we'd learned to live a life of crime
Rewind us back to a time was much too young to know
I caught a felony, lovin' the way the guns blow
And even though we separated, you said that you'd wait
Don't give nobody no coochie while I'll be locked up state
I kiss my mama goodbye and wipe the tears from her lonely eyes
Said I'll return but I gotta fight, the fate's arrived
Don't shed a tear,'cause Mama, I ain't happy here
I blew trial, no more smiles for a couple years
They got me goin' mad, I'm knockin' busters on they backs
In my cell, thinkin', 
Hell, I know one day I'll be back.
As soon as I touch down
I told my girl I'd be there, so prepare to get fucked down
The homies wanna kick it, but I'm just laughin' at cha
'Cause you's a down-ass bitch and I ain't mad at cha
I ain't mad at cha
I ain't mad at cha
I ain't mad at cha
Well, guess who's movin' up, this nigga's ballin' now
Bitches be callin' to get it, hookers keep fallin' down
He went from nothin' to lots, ten carats to rock
Went from a nobody nigga to the big man on the block
He's Mr. Local-Celebrity, addicted to movin' ki's
Most hated by enemies, escape in the luxury
See, first you was our nigga, but you made it so the choice is made
Now we gotta slay you while you faded, in the younger days
So full of pain while the weapons blaze
Gettin' so high off that bomb, hopin' we make it to the better days
'Cause crime pays, and in time you'll find a rhyme'll blaze
You'll feel the fire from the niggas in my younger days
So many changed on me, so many tried to plot
That I keep a Glock beside my head, when will it stop? 
'Til God return me to my essence
'Cause even as an adolescent, I refused to be a convalescent
So many questions and they ask me if I'm still down
I moved up out of the ghetto, so I ain't real now? 
They got so much to say, but I'm just laughin' at cha
You niggas just don't know, but I ain't mad at cha
I ain't mad at cha
I ain't mad at cha
I ain't mad at cha

What's your phone number? 
Now, I could make miracles to tempos
I's instrumental, waitin' for the nymphos: that's the intro
Shook when you rush me, walked up and touched me
Why? Do you wanna fuck me? 
Just ‘cause I'm paid in the worst way? True! 
Lookin' kinda good in your birthday suit
I wonder if you're wild and you act shy
Do you like to be on top or the back side? 
Watch me while you lick your lips
Shake your hips, goddamn, I love that shit
Yo, let's stop fakin', be real now
I got a room and a hard-on – still down? 
Met you standin' at a bar full of black dudes
Said you wanna see my scars and my tattoos
When we head for my hideout, act right
Boss player when I ride out, that's right
What's ya phone number? 
If you really wanna fuck with me, I'm ready
Baby, let me give you a call
How long will it take to break you off? 
If you really wanna fuck with me, I'm ready
Baby, let me give you a call
How long will it take to break you off? 
Oh shit, baby is a dime piece, more than just fine
She's personally blessed from the gods
If I seen her right now, she could get me hard
Didn't wanna talk to me just to see my car
Never had sex with a rich rap star
'Til I got her in the back of my homeboy's car
Tell me, why do we live this way? 
Money over bitches, let me hear you say
What's your phone number? Are you alone? 
Got a pocket full of rubbers, let's bone! 
Time for your girlfriend to take you home
I had fun, but baby, gotta leave me alone
Picture in my rhyme, take time to rewind these words I say
If you open your mind, bet in a minute you'll find
I's time let the Outlawz play; what's ya phone number? 
If you really wanna fuck with me, I'm ready
Baby, let me give you a call
How long will it take to break you off? 
If you really wanna fuck with me, I'm ready
Baby, let me give you a call
How long will it take to break you off?

 Bye, boo
 Hah, yeah, I'm gonna get some pussy
Heh, get some pussy, hah, hah
The blind stares of a million pairs of eyes
Lookin' hard but won't realize
That they will never see the P! 
You must be goin' blind
Give me my money in stacks and lace my bitches with dime figures
Real niggas fingers on nickel-plated 9 triggers
Must see my enemies defeated
I catch'em while they coked up and weeded
Open fire, now them niggas bleedin'
See me in flesh and test and get your chest blown
Straight out the West, don't get blown
My adversaries cry like hoes, open and shut like doors
Is you a friend or foe? Nigga, you ain't know? 
They got me stressed out on Death Row
I've seen money, but baby, I've gots to get mo'
You screamin', 
Go 2Pac!  and I ain't stoppin' till I'm well-paid
Bail's paid now, nigga, look what hell made
Visions of cops and sirens, niggas open fire
Bunch of Thug Life niggas on the rise, until I die
Ask me why I'm a boss player gettin' high
And when I'm rollin' by niggas can't see me! 
The stares of a million pairs of eyes
And you'll never realize
You can't see me
Been gettin' word that these square motherfuckers with nerves
Sayin' they can get with us, but picture me gettin' served
My own mama say I'm thugged out
My shit be bumpin' out the record store as if it was a drug house
My lyrics bang like a Crip or Blood
Nigga what! It ain't nothin' but a party when we thug
And there I was, a young nigga with heart, ain't had shit to lose
Pullin' my pistol on them fools, you know the rules
D-R-E, you got me heated; my words like a penitentiary dick
Hittin' bitches where it's most needed
Money and weed, Alizé and Hennessy
To my thug niggas in lock down: witness me
Bail on these hoes in floss-mode
The life of a boss player, fuck what you thought though
My enemies deceased
Die like a bitch when my album hit the streets; niggas can't see me! 
Niggas can't see me
They can't see me
Which way did he go, George? 
Which way did he go? 
Oh! ! Which way did he go? 
Which way did he go? 
You niggas made a mistake
You shoulda never put my rhymes with Dre
Them thug niggas have arrived and it's judgement day
Hey homie, if you feel me
Tell them tricks that shot me that they missed, they ain't kill me
I can make a motherfucker shake, rattle and roll
I'm full of liquor, thug nigga, quick to jab at them hoes
And I can make you jealous niggas famous
Fuck around with 2Pac and see how good a nigga's aim is
I'm just a rich motherfucker from the way
If this rappin' bring me money, then I'm rappin' till I'm paid
I'm gettin' green like I'm supposed to
Nigga, I holla at these hoes and see how many I can go through
Look to the star and visualize my debut
Niggas know me, player, I gotta stay true
Don't be a dumb motherfucker'cause it's crazy after dark
Where the true thug-niggas see your heart; niggas can't see me! 
Yo, check this out: stay off his dick
Niggas can't see me
Right before your eyes, I'll disappear from here
You niggas can't see me
You can't see me
I know it's hard nigga, I'm all up in your face
But you still can't see me
You can't see me
All up in your range, but niggas can't see me
20/20 vision won't visualize
I'm in the flesh, baby, but you can't see me
All those glasses won't help you realize
You blinded, you blinded, you can't see me
You can't see me
Thug Life, baby
Don't believe everything you read! 
Alizé and weed
You can't see me, right before your very eyes
You won't even visualize, you can't see me
Dr. Dre all day, 2Pac
Niggas can't see me
I dedicate this to you punk motherfuckers! 
This one's for you, BIG baby
'Cause you bitch-ass niggas can't see me
Niggas can't see me
You can't see me
See no evil, hear no evil, speak no evil
You won't see me
Yeah, first see me, now you don't
Wanna see me, but you won't
Come to see me, but you can't
Oh, you can't see me, you can't see me
Right between your eyes and you'll never realize
Right before your eyes, you won't even realize
Visualize what you can't see
Said he wanna be, shorty's gonna be a thug
Said he wanna be, one day he's gonna be
Said he's gonna be, shorty's gonna be a thug
Said he's gonna be, one day he's gonna be
Said he wanna be, shorty's gonna be a thug! 
Said he wanna be, one day he's gonna be
Said he wanna be, shorty's gonna be a thug
Was a nice middle-class nigga
But no one knew the evil he'd do when he got a little bigger
You'd often find him blazed, for puffing on a Newport
Plotting on a another way to catch a case
Was only 16, yet convicted as a felon
With a bunch of old niggas, but you the only one ain't tellin'
I tell you it's a cold world, stay in school
You tell me it's a man's world, play the rules
And fade fools, break rules until we major
Blaze up, getting with hoes through my pager
Was raised up, commence to money-makin' tactics
I's getting drastic, niggas got automatics
My finger's on the trigger
Tell the Lord to make way for another straight thug nigga
I'm sitting, getting buzzed, looking for some love
From the homies, ‘cause shorty wanna be a thug
Said he's gonna be, said he's gonna be
One day he's gonna be, shorty's gonna be a thug
Said he's wanna be, said he's wanna be
One day he's gonna be, shorty's gonna be a thug
Said he's gonna be, one day he's gonna be
Said he wanna be, shorty's gonna be a thug
Said he wanna be, one day he's gonna be
Said he wanna be, shorty's gonna be a thug
Straight from the hall to the pen
An adolescent nigga standing way higher than six feet ten
He carried weight, like a Mack truck
Gonna bust on playa haters, if them mothafuckas act tuff
Then that's when, a lethal weapon with the razor
This little nigga smoking weed and getting blazed up
No one could figure, when the guns blast, pull the trigger
Could take the life of a young nigga, guns bigger
No mother and father, you see, the nigga's all alone
Old timers my role model, the war zone
Been laced with this game'til it's a part of me
My heart don't beat no fear, and that ain't hard to see
The future is looking dim
I'm tryin' to make a profit out of living in this sin
I'm in the dark, getting buzzed, looking for some love
Out with the homies, ‘cause shorty wanna be a thug
Said he's gonna be, said he's gonna be
One day he's gonna be, shorty's gonna be a thug
Said he's wanna be, one day he's gonna be
Said he's gonna be, shorty's gonna be a thug
Said he's wanna be, one day he's gonna be
Said he wanna be, shorty's gonna be a thug
Said he wanna be, one day he's gonna be
Said he wanna be, shorty's gonna be a thug
Shorty's gonna be a thug
Little bad ass nigga, to the young niggas
Gotta stay sharp, nigga, play your part! 
Got plenty of time 
You only get three mistakes, and then it's life, big baby
 Watch the signs! 
Damn, nigga! Sixteen, nigga? 
Sixteen? ! Too bad, mothafuckers
Niggas out there jealous cause we be bailin' with Death Row
They try to playa hate, but they can't fade us though
We be mobbin' through the neighborhood, yeah
With that funky sound 
We be throwin' down
This goes out to you playa
You know, you know who you are
Gotta be careful, can't let the evil of the money trap me
So when ya see me nigga, you better holla at me
Gotta be careful, can't let the evil of the money trap me
So when ya see me nigga, you better holla at me
Gotta be careful, can't let the evil of the money trap me
So when ya see me nigga, you better holla at me
Are you confused? 
You wonder how it feels to walk a mile inside the shoes of a nigga who don't have a thing to lose
When me and you was homies
No one informed me it was all a scheme
You infiltrated my team and sold a nigga's dreams
How could you do me like that? 
I took ya family in
I put some cash in ya pocket, made you a man again
And now you let the fear put your ass in a place
Complicated to escape, it's a fool's fate
Without your word you're a shell of a man
I lost respect for ya, nigga
We can never be friends
I know I'm runnin' through your head now
What could you do? 
If it was up to you, I'd be dead now
I let the world know, nigga, you a coward
Ya could never be live
Until you die
See the motherfuckin' bitch in your eye
Type of nigga, that let the evil of the money trap me
When ya see me, nigga, you better holla at me 
Gotta be afraid, don’t let the evil of the money trap me
So when ya see me, nigga, you better holla at me
You better beware where you lay
We better not find where you stay
So I gotta be careful, can't let the evil of the money trap me
So when ya see me, nigga, you better holla at me
You better beware where you lay
We better not find where you stay
Curious, spittin' lyrics on the verge of furious
I'm addicted to currency
Nigga that's why we're doin' this
I got shot up, I surprised the niggas the way I got up
And then I hit the studio, it's time to blow the block up
No hesitation
This information got you contemplatin'
Heartbreakin' and eliminatin' with this conversation
Break him and let him see the face of a mental patient
I's a celebration of my criminal elevation, more participation
I want members that call the fifty states
To keep the nation anticipatin' until we break
Will I be great, is it my fate? 
To live the life of luxury, some niggas bought my tapes
So much jealousy it scares me
So be prepared, cause only the strong survive
Life isn't fair 
Probably never knew the way it feels to die
So you see come fuck with me, I give that ass a try! ! 
Nigga, holla at me
Gotta be careful, can't let the evil of the money trap me
So when ya see me, nigga, you better holla at me
You better beware where you lay
We better not find where you stay
And now I gotta be careful, can't let the evil of the money trap me
So when ya see me, nigga, you better holla at me
You better beware where you lay
We better not find where you stay
I should've saw the signs, I was blinded
Criminal minds of a young black brotha doin' time
So many brothas framed in this dirty game
I's a shame, so much pressure on my brain while she blame me
Secrets in the dark, only her and I know
Now I'm sittin' in the state pen', doin' time slow
Guess she made a bad decision
That got me livin' just like an animal
I'm caged up in state prison
My niggas dissin' cause hell hath no fury like a woman's scorn
A cemetery full of motherfuckers not knowin'
Picture my prophecy I got some attacking me, on top of me
I'm runnin' from the coppers, but never let'em stop me
Cause I'm a soldier
Hell, ever since I was a little nigga havin' fantasies of one day getting older
Niggas is paranoid, trust; a no no
Love is a mystery, fuck the po po
Holla at me
So when you see me nigga
You better holla at me
You better beware where you lay
We better not find where you stay
Gotta be careful, can't let the evil of the money trap me
So when ya see me, nigga, you better holla at me
You better beware where you lay
We better not find where you stay
A nigga gotta be careful, can't let the evil of the money trap me
So when ya see me, nigga, you better holla at me
You better beware where you lay
We better not find where you stay
Niggas out there jealous cause we be bailin' with Death Row
They try to playa hate, but they can't fade us tho'
We be mobbin' through the neighborhood, yeah
With that funky sound 
We be throwin' down
Gotta be careful, can't let the evil of the money trap me
So when ya see me nigga, you better holla at me
You better beware where you lay
We better not find where you stay
Gotta be careful, can't let the evil of the money trap me
So when ya see me nigga, you better holla at me
You better beware where you lay
We better not find where you stay
You wonda why they call you bitch
You wonda why they call you bitch
You wonda why they call you bitch
You wonda why they call you bitch
You wonda why they call you bitch
You wonda why they call you bitch
Look here, Miss Thang, hate to salt your game
But you's a money-hungry woman and you need to change
In the locker room, all the homies do is laugh
High fives ‘cause another nigga played your ass
It was said you were sleezy, even easy
Sleepin' around for what you need, see
I's your thing, and you can shake it how you wanna
Give it up free or make your money on the corner
But don't be bad, play the game, get mad and change
Then you wonder why these motherfuckers call you names
Still lookin' for a way out, and that's okay
I can see you wanna stray, there's a way out
Keep your mind on your money, enroll in school
And as the years pass by, you can show them fools
But you ain't tryin' to hear me ‘cause you're stuck
You're headin' for the bathroom,'bout to get tossed up
Still lookin' for a rich man, you dug a ditch
Got your legs up tryin' to get rich
I love you like a sister, but you need to switch
And that's why they called you bitch—I betcha! 
You wonda why they call you bitch
You wonda why they call you bitch
I betcha
You wonda why they call you bitch
You wonda why they call you bitch
I betcha, bitch
You wonda why they call you bitch
You wonda why they call you bitch
I betcha
You wonda why they call you bitch
You wonda why they call you bitch
You leave your kids with your mama
‘Cause your headin' for the club
In a skin-tight miniskirt, lookin' for some love
Got them legs wide open while you're sittin' at the bar
Talkin' to some nigga'bout his car
I guess he said he had a Lexus, what's next? 
You headin' to his car for some sex? 
I pass by, can't hold back tears inside
‘Cause Lord knows, for years I tried
And all the other people on my block hate your guts
Then you wonder why they stare and call you slut
I's like your mind don't understand
You don't have to kill your dreams plottin' schemes on a man
Keep your head up, legs closed, eyes open
Either a nigga wear a rubber or he die smokin'
I'm hearin' rumors, so you need to switch
And niggas wouldn't call you bitch—I betcha! 
You wonda why they call you bitch
You wonda why they call you bitch
I betcha
You wonda why they call you bitch
You wonda why they call you bitch
I betcha, bitch
You wonda why they call you bitch
You wonda why they call you bitch
I betcha
You wonda why they call you bitch
You wonda why they call you bitch
I guess times gettin' hard, even harder for you
‘Cause hey now, got a baby on the way now
More money from the county, and thanks to the welfare
You're about to get your hair done
Got a dinner date, can't be late
Trick or treat, sweet thang got another trick to meet
The way he did it it was smooth
Plottin' while he gamin' you so, baby, peep the rules
I should've seen it in the first case, the worst case
I should've never called you back in the first place
I remember back in high school, baby, you was fast
Straight sex when you moved your ass
But now things change, ‘cause you don't look the same
Let the ghetto get the best of you, baby, that's a shame
Caught HIV and now you'bout to be deceased
And finally be at peace
So where your niggas at now? ‘Cause everybody left
They stepped, and left you on your own
See, I loved you like a sister, but you died too quick
And that's why we called you bitch—I betcha! 
You wonda why we call you bitch
You wonda why we call you bitch
I betcha, bitch
You wonda why we call you bitch
You wonda why we call you bitch
I betcha, bitch
You wonda why we call you bitch
You wonda why we call you bitch
I betcha, bitch
You wonda why we call you bitch
You wonda why we call you bitch
Dear Ms. Delores Tucker, keep stressin' me
Fuckin' with a motherfuckin' mind
I figured you wanted to know
You know, why we call them hoes bitches
And maybe this might help you understand
It ain't personal, strictly business, baby, strictly business
So If you wonder why we call you bitch
You wonder why we call you bitch
If you wonder why we call you bitch
You wonder why we call you bitch
Outlaw Immortalz
Bow down to somethin' greater than yourself, trick
Individuals capable of enormous amounts of chin checks and eye swolls
They know you watchin'
But you ain't seein' what lies before you, biatch
Picture if you will seven deadly human beings
Blessed with the gift of speech
The power to reach
Each nigga on every street
May the heavenly father look down and be proud of what transpired
Since the day the seed was planted
The G grew but we knew he'd rise up quick
Smoked out, loc'ed out, all into shit
Just me and my dogs, livin' like hogs
Outlaw Immortalz
What follows is the story, what proceeded was the glue
What lies between is the fiction
Don't fuck around and make it true
My adversaries crumble when we rumble it's a catastrophe
Out for revenge on bitch niggas that blasted me
Plus my alias is Makaveli
A loaded three-fifty-seven with hollow points to a nigga belly
Bust him to see if he bleed
He shoulda never fucked around with a sick-ass nigga like me
They call my name out and niggas run
Best be prepared for the Outlawz, here we come
They call me Hussein Fatal, it's a two game table
I'm robbin' ya niggas' cradle with a knife in your navel
Rap-related, criminally activated and evil
I wouldn't wanna be you behind my fuckin' Desert Eagle
'Til the end, I'm tellin' all friends and enemies
You see what I got to make you freeze, to touch me you need ten of these
Complete most, wanted on the streets of the East coast
Young Gunz fire and niggas bleed, I see Mo
I be shinin' like white diamonds and crystal
Glistenin' holdin' pistols
The mission's simple, fold up and roll up dead presidentials
Sew up all the potential, million, billion dollar baller potential
Sort it, oughta call on a nigga I'll be sure to get you
Take cash bro, fast yo, for my Kastro
Blast and I'mma last yo past all these Glass Joes
And assholes who claim, like they be runnin' thangs
I be gunnin' those same niggas runnin' late, to their fate
My alias is motherfuckin' Na-poleon, and I'd rather be
Robbin' again before these motherfuckers leave me sufferin'
But it ain't nothin', and I got no time for no bluffin'
Befo' a nigga finish with puttin' in work I betta end up with somethin'
I think these niggas got the game fucked up
If they don't believe, that a young nigga like me, would bust 
Perhaps it's a must, I'm facin' cases, fuck probation
Is what I'm screamin' when these money hungry cops be chasin'
Thug nigga'til we die
No mercy on these playa hatin' bitches, ask me why - when we ride
Thug nigga'til we die
No mercy on these playa hatin' bitches, ask me why - when we ride
I's the imperial serial killer, alias Mussolini
Mentally unstable G status, so you can't see me
Drug warlord, ridin' Concorde jets
Rag Vette's, shakin' bitches and snitches and trippin' on sets
Inglewoods banger, keepin' one in the chamber
For the anger that I build inside, when it's time to ride
Suicidal thoughts lurk fuckin' no end to revenge
Fuck any, my alias Mussolini
They call me Idi, from the side of seedy
Young nigga greedy, so I'm runnin' up on these niggas easy
It ain't nuttin, cause if they wantin' somethin', so I'mma commence
To dumpin' stomp down and struck up while my beat is bumpin', Thuggin'
To my fuckin' last note, with Lo-Pole and Kastro
Who you thought was on that asshole, don't ask though
Outlaw Immortalz doin' this dit-nirt on the sli-zow
Ain't no chance to hide when we ride
My alias Khadafi, Trump tight so feds can't copy
Six-three and cocky quick to hit your bitch if she jock me
Severely addicted to livin' like a fuckin' felon
While beefin' with rookie cops the cookie rocks a nigga sellin'
Since a shorty I been livin' life defiant, nickel plated chrome
Got this baby Capone lookin' like a giant, and I ain't lyin'
I's like it's me against myself with all these
Backstabbin' snakes grabbin' at my fuckin' wealth
Mo Khomeini goes terrorist, mad man killer
The bottom of the river where the body lays and shivers
I'm that nigga with the fifty cap pouch, with the murderous stacks
That increase, while these motherfuckers eat beef
I's been a long road, a lot of episodes
And as the Glock loads, I gotta teach hoes
Reach hoes, make'em feel a nigga when I'm mashin'
Now I'm surpassin' any assassin'
Thug nigga'til we die
No mercy on these playa hatin' bitches, ask me why - when we ride
Thug nigga'til we die
No mercy on these playa hatin' bitches, ask me why - when we ride
Thug nigga'til we die
No mercy on these playa hatin' bitches, ask me why - when we ride
Thug nigga'til we die
No mercy on these playa hatin' bitches, ask me why - when we ride

The gunshots can't stop me, they know 
Aight, new drink
One part Alizé, one part Cristal
Thug passion, baby
Y'all know what time it is
This drink is guaranteed to get the pussy wet and the dick hard
Now, if you with me
Pour a glass and drink with a nigga, knowhatimean? 
I ain't tryin' to turn you all niggas into alcohols - alcoholics
I'm just tryin' to turn you into motherfuckin' thugs
So come and get some of this thug passion, baby
Mayne! , I could pull out the drink and be good until it's relevant
But I'm a straight soldier, I'll roll up a nigga like it's Heaven sent
Trippin' over dead presidents
They got these derelicts
I throw was down with this business, tryin' to clown and get a cent
And so rather, than stand forever
Been thinkin' drinkin' over a felony
And hell of me
And how it will be in hella shit, people tellin' me to cool out
But they ain't feelin' me, a motherfuckin' fool, about
My fuckin' cheddar cheese
And it pleases, passion of mine
Thuggin', huggin' plenty of G's and laughin' while I pass through times
And all these bastards be watchin' just keep it plain
I'ma keep it the same partner, just take it the simple game
I can, pinkle with the rain twinklin'
Diamonds and things go blinkin'
Enough to hold me,'til I'm, old and wrinklin'
And these adversaries
They gonna have to be worryin'
Cause I'ma be illin', fulfillin' my passion
'Til I'm buryin' my thug passion
I heard it's the bomb
And you got it goin' on
Give me some of your thug passion, baby
You got me drippin' wet
From the way you make me sweat
Give me some of your thug passion, baby ohhhwow! 
Now what if me
Turn this Hennessy into a robbery
The Prophecy probably suddenly switch and how it supposed to be
And dirty money
Can't be evil cause it's fillin' up my tummy
Born in a position, death collision was futuristic
Twistin' riches, but there is only one way to make more
So I'm standin' on the corner tryin' to hustle in the snow
And my bigger bro, couldn't know
But buy a.44, blastin' at playa haters wantin' more
With a thug passion
Puttin' down mashin', control by this thug's passion
Unlike them other bustas pistol blastin'
I'm askin', what happened
To the niggas who kept it real like they claim to
That's what money and fame do, see they ain't true
Travelin' this road my poor soul has been consolidated
With all this bullshit that I done tolerated
How I made it, can be easily stated
I's like my hardest bring the grip with the passion, left me to fuckin' greatest
Load up and take shit
Make it to some high dollar gangsta shit
Jack a stack'til we got enough bank to split
Creep with me, through that immortal flow
Thug passion got you tremblin' like Death on the Row
Make your move, so I can throw your mind a curve
While I'll be blowin' up the scene, like my nigga Mr. Herb
Take a toke, as your heart goes full arrest
I got the bomb, so nigga, fuck the rest
You need a dub to get you flowin'
And let that loc see smoke
Feelin' the strokes of the 9 squeeze tight and slow
I heard it's the bomb
And you got it goin' on
Give me some of your thug passion, baby
You got me drippin' wet
From the way you make me sweat
Give me some of your thug passion, baby ohhhwow! 
They say money don't make the man
But damn, I'm makin' money
Observin' you motherfuckers,'cause some of you bitches funny
Say you want it but you bullshittin'
Lickin' them lips, you got me about to act a fool quick
Sippin' on some Alizé and Cristal, meanwhile
Buy me a drink and get to winkin' at me, she smiles; a niggas full of passion
Satisfaction is everlastin'
How does it feel?  what I'm askin'
While I'm rubbin' on that ass 
Why you laughin'? 
See, I'm diggin' as if I'm curious
Full blown and furious
Baby, get a grip, when I be doin' this
I's so physical my attraction
Driven by alcohol, beware of my reaction
Baby I'm born to ball
Thugged out on Death Row
You better recognize and picture what I said so
Now you can feel it, it's a portion for my niggas in motion
Forever blastin', bitches ain't ready for this thug passion
I heard it's the bomb
And you got it goin' on
Give me some of your thug passion, baby
Thug passion
You got me drippin' wet
From the way you make me sweat
Give me some of your thug passion, baby ohhhwow! 
Thug passion
I heard it's the bomb
And you got it goin' on
Give me some of your thug passion, baby
Thug passion
You got me drippin' wet
From the way you make me sweat
Give me some of your thug passion, baby ohhhwow! 
Thug passion
I heard it's the bomb
And you got it goin' on
Give me some of your thug passion, baby
You got me drippin' wet
From the way you make me sweat
Give me some of your thug passion, baby ohhhwow! 
I heard it's the bomb
And you got it goin' on
Give me some of your thug passion, baby
You got me drippin' wet
From the way you make me sweat
Give me some of your thug passion, baby ohhhwow!
Yeah, clear enough for ya? 
My niggas look mad
Y'all supposed to be happy I'm free! 
Y'all niggas look like y'all wanted me to stay in jail
Ho bustas! 
Picture me rollin' in my 500 Benz
I got no love for these niggas, there's no need to be friends
They got me under surveillance
That's what somebody be tellin'
Know there's dope bein' sold,  but I ain't the one sellin'
Don't want to be another number
I gotta puff a gang of weed to keep from goin' under
The federales wanna see me dead
Niggas put prices on my head
Now I got two Rottweilers by my bed, I feed'em lead
Now I'm released, how will I live? 
Will God forgive me for all the dirt a nigga did, to feed kids? 
One life to live, it's so hard to be positive
When niggas shootin' at your crib
Mama, I'm still thuggin', the world is a war zone
My homies is inmates, and most of them dead wrong
Full grown, finally a man, just schemin' on ways
To put some green inside the palms of my empty hands
Just picture me rollin'
Flossin' a Benz on rims that isn't stolen
My dreams is censored, my hopes are gone
I'm like a fiend that finally sees when all the dope is gone
My nerves is wrecked, heart beatin'
And my hands are swollen
Thinkin' of the G's I'll be holdin'; picture me rollin'
Picture me rollin'
Picture me rollin'
Picture me, picture me rollin'
Picture me rollin'
Ooh wee
Can you see me now? 
Move to the side a little bit so you can get a clear picture
Can you see it? 
Picture me rollin'
Yeah, nigga! 
Aye, but peep how my nigga Syke do it to you
Guess who's back? 
I got ki's comin' from overseas
Cost a nigga 200 G's
I'm a street commando, Nino for example
This lavish lifestyle is hard to handle
So I got to floss'cause I'm more like a boss player
Thug, branded to be a women-layer
So many player haters, imitators steady swangin'
Make me wanna start back bangin'
So I'm caught up in the game, dress code changed
Packin' 40 Glocks, contain'em or rearrange
All that jealousy and envy comin' from my enemies
While I'm sippin' on Rémy
In front of black Lexus, Chevy's on the roam
'96 big body, sittin' on chrome
As we head up out the zone, stone-facin' is on
You can admire, but don't look too long
I'm livin' a dream with triple beams and my pockets bulgin'
I's hard to imagine, picture me rollin'
Picture me rollin'
Picture, picture me rollin'
Picture me rollin'
Picture me rollin'
Picture me
I gots to get the fuck up in it, formulate a caper
'Cause a nigga straight sufferin' from lack of havin' paper
My bitch fin' to have a bastard, see? 
So I needs to hit a lick, drastically
I see some ballin'-ass niggas, and they slippin' in my spot
And, uh, diggin' the plots 
Checkin' in the park,'Pac
We caught him sleepin'
He didn't peep you niggas creepin'? 
This how we do it every weekend
I dump for madness, it's time to count the profit
CPO, you got the bomb spot
Nigga, time to clock it
I get the liquor, and you can get the females
This crooked shit that we inflictin', gettin' street sales
Move smooth as a motherfucker, me and my 9
I'm cool as a motherfucker, I'ma get mine
Now we satisfied, got the pockets on swoll
Boss Hogg and this'Pac nigga, picture us rollin'
Picture me rollin'
Picture me
Picture me rollin'
Picture me rollin'
Is y'all ready for me? 
Picture me rollin' roll call
You know there's some muh'fuckers out there
I just could not forget about
I wanna make sure they can see me
Number one on my list: Clinton Correctional Facilities
All you bitch-ass CO's
Can you niggas see me from there? 
Ballin' on y'all punk-ass! 
Picture me rollin', baby! 
Yeah, all them niggas up in them cell blocks
I told y'all niggas when I come home it's on
That's right, nigga, picture me rollin'
Oh, I forgot! The DA
Yeah, that bitch had a lot to talk about in court
Can the ho see me from here? 
Can you see me, ho? Picture me rollin'
And all you punk police, can you see me? 
Am I clear to you? 
Picture me rollin', nigga, legit
Free like O.J. all day, you can't stop me
You know I got my niggas up in this motherfucker
Manute, Pain, Syke, Bogart, Mopreme
I's sad, dog, can you picture us rollin'? 
Can you see me, ho? 
Is y'all ready for me? We up out this bitch
Any time y'all wanna see me again
Rewind this track right here
Close your eyes and picture me rollin'
Ay what time is it nigga? 
Oh shit, 12 o'clock
Oh shit, we got to get the fuck up outta here
Nigga, it's check out time nigga
Hey call up Kurupt, call Daz room
Call Suge, call all the niggas tell'em to meet me downstairs
Tell the valet, bring the Benz around
Hey Kurupt, y'all niggas drivin' or y'all flyin' back, whassup? 
Hey Syke nigga, come on man, get up out the bathroom fool
Aw nigga, damn
Now I'm up early in the mornin', breath stinkin' as I'm yawnin'
Just another sunny day in California
I got my mind focused on some papers while I'm into sexy capers
Give a holla to them hoochies last night, that tried to rape us
Will these rap lyrics take us, plus room all up in Vegas
I'm a boss playa, death before I let these bitches break us
Last night was like a fantasy, Alizé and Hennessy
A hoochie and her homie dirty dancin' with my man and me
Told her I was interested, picture all the shit we did
I got her hot and horny, all up on me, what a freaky bitch
First you argued, then I fight it,'til you lick me where I like it
Got a nigga all excited, it don't matter, just don't bite it
I never got to check out the scene
Too busy tryin' to dig a hole in your jeans
Now it seems, it's check out time
We gotta go, we gotta go! 
We gotta go, we gotta go! 
We gotta go, we gotta go! 
Gotta go, gotta go
Yeah baby, hahaha, it's check it out time! ! 
Gotta go nigga, gotta go
Ay, c'mon man get y'all bags man, call that valet motherfucker
Tell him to get a nigga shit, cause we out this, motherfucker
They label me an outlaw, so it's time for the panty raid
My fantasies came true with Janet on, I'm in a escapade
But did it all, end too soon
All the homies runnin' through the halls room to room
So I assume, since I'm a playa like my nigga Syke
Then it's only right for me to disappear into the night
My game's trump tight
So I find time to recline
Sneak in your room, instant Messiah, shit wines of all kinds
I ain't got that much time
So hurry up and pop the Dom and let me hit it from behind
Since I'm only here for one night
I got to get you hot and heated
Play like Micheal Jackson, and Beat It
One more thing I like to mention, I'm done and I'm out
Cause there's someone else who deserves my attention
So all the homies round up in the lobby
Cause bustin' bitches is a hobby, nigga
I's check out time
We gotta go, we gotta go! 
We gotta go, we gotta go! 
We gotta go, we gotta go! 
We gotta go, we gotta go! 
Aiyyo man'Pac, ay, where the where the fuck is Daz at man? 
This nigga locked up or somethin'? 
The only one not to leave
Yo man, it's check out time, it's time to get out this mother
We out man, fuck that shit
Yo Rece! Yo nigga, whassup? 
Hey, I'm livin' the life of a boss playa
The front desk callin' but I'm checkin' out later
My behavior is crazy from what you did to me baby
If walls could talk, they'd say, you tried to fade me
I'm puttin' in work, but didn't hurt from the jacuzzi to the bed
Carressin' your thoughts, cause I'm livin' fed, heard what I said? 
Passion is crashin' the room
From the liquor we consumed I heard a boom
I'm blackin' out, you're yellin' out'Big Syke Daddy'
We did it in the caddy on the highway, my way
I'm lost in a dream and so it seemed, to be the night
Five bottles of Cristal and I'm still tight
Out of sight from'Pac and Kurupt
As I get it up, once the doors close, you stuck
In a heaty, sticky situation
Get up baby, you ain't on vacation
I's check out time
We gotta go, we gotta go! 
We gotta go, we gotta go! 
We gotta go, we gotta go! 
We gotta go, we gotta go! 
Ay, it's check out time
Ay Pac, nigga where my motherfuckin', where my shoes go, nigga? 
Where my motherfuckin' drawers and shit at man? 
Man, y'all niggas was in here partyin' too fuckin' much
What the fuck y'all doin', nigga? 
Kurupt, go tell Daz, man, and Bogart and the rest of them niggas
C'mon man, niggas is trippin' man
Front desk all callin' me, tellin' me to get the hell outta here, man
I ain't got no more money, somebody loan me a hundred
We gotta go, we gotta go! 
We gotta go, we gotta go! 
We gotta go, we gotta go! 
We gotta go, we gotta go! 
We gotta go! ! ! oooo! ! 
We gotta, go! ! ! 
We, heyyy! 
We! ! , we gotta go! .. haaa! ! 
We gotta, go! ! haa! !'Pac
Hey
What's happening
Not motherfucking double R, Richie baby
What's happening baby, you know how we do it
Yeah nigga, you know I'm up out this bitch
I's time for me to uhhh regulate
Fo' sho', hey
Observe
And you ain't going back? 
Nah nah nah, we got to show these motherfuckers whassup though
This is for the honeys, the superstar
I don't want to be her man, I want to be her nigga
You feel me? 
Well let'em know
You fucking with niggas that's insecure
Watered down, my shit is pure
Write down my number but don't call me'til you sure
I ain't begging just trying to relocate between your legs
Dripping wet, as we experiment in sweaty sex
When you met me you wouldn't let me, and now
You straight begging to sex me got you undressing to test me and uhh..
Shut me down if you want, and miss the chance to do it live
When I stroll by, I see that look in yo' eye
You want a nigga, but think that you can't have a nigga
Don't cheat yourself, instead treat yourself
If you scared, go to church, I know it hurts
To find out me and your man be sharing skirts
I'm hoping you don't take this the wrong way
But your body is banging, got me attracted in a strong way
After a long day of trying to make my songs pay
Making love all day against the wall in the hallway
Your fantasies come alive, your heart rate
Shall increase when we meet up in this dark place
You might think you're happy with him
But that's a lie, so give this thug a try
I'd rather be ya nigga
I'd rather be ya N-I-G-G-A
So we can get drunk and smoke weed all day
It don't matter if you lonely baby, you need a thug in your life
These busters ain't loving you right
I'd rather be ya N-I-G-G-A
So we can get drunk and smoke weed all day
It don't matter if you lonely baby, you need a thug in your life
 These busters ain't loving you right
 Look, now you was sprung from the introduction
My conversation's full of game yet laced with seductions
I see you blushing like you want something, come get a taste
Of Amerikaz Most Wanted and let's get into some touching, erotic fuckin'
My up and down with no interruptions
Have no intentions of busting until you learn your lesson
Now many questions are often asked, a drop top, 500 Benz
And plenty cash, to help a nigga get the ass
You can ride out with spoke coke, to get your lobster and crab
Cause all I got is conversation and a gang of stab
And I'ma listen when it hurts, I'ma hang out but never stay
Smoke blunts but leave them stunts up to Super Dave
I'll be your nigga, as long as we can understand
That I's the nigga and spoke coke can be the man
He wine and dine, but me and you we whine and grind
And when I'm on the field keep you on the sidelines
I'd rather be ya N-I-G-G-A
So we can get drunk and smoke weed all day
It don't matter if you lonely baby, you need a thug in your life
Them busters ain't loving you right
I'd rather be ya N-I-G-G-A
So we can get drunk and smoke weed all day
It don't matter if you lonely baby, you need a thug in your life
Them busters ain't loving you right
Now it's time for the moment of truth, I got you naked
Totally sweating, let's see how hot I can make it
Tongue kissing'til yo' head swang
I'm so into you, witness a nigga make the bed bang
If it's all mine, then let me know
Now scream my name out; do you want it fast or shall I hit it slow? 
Not to mention, the multiple positions I inflict
A boss player, freaky motherfucker, can I dig? 
I's on and popping, now you see what I was seeing
Why your eyes rolling? Loosen up, girl, I ain't going
Nowhere, let's let that sucker stay out there
While he's stressed out and knock I stretch out the cock
Hold the boots, and let a nigga execute
And though you got it right, I'm going home tonight
You say you don't need a man, but I don't care
You're in the presence of a player, I'd rather be ya nigga
I'd rather be ya N-I-G-G-A
So we can get drunk and smoke weed all day
It don't matter if you lonely baby, you need a thug in your life
These busters ain't loving you right
So I'd rather be ya N-I-G-G-A
So we can get drunk and smoke weed all day
It don't matter if you lonely baby, you need a thug in your life
These busters ain't loving you right
I'd rather be ya N-I-G-G-A
So we can get drunk and smoke weed all day
It don't matter if you lonely baby, you need a thug in your life
These busters ain't loving you right
I'd rather be ya N-I-G-G-A
Big Syke, Newt, Hank, Beugard, Big Sur
Y'all know how this shit go
All eyes on me
Motherfuckin' OG
Roll up in the club and shit, is that right? 
All eyes on me
All eyes on me
But you know what? 
I bet you got it twisted, you don't know who to trust
So many playa-hatin' niggas tryin' to sound like us
Say they ready for the funk, but I don't think they knowin'
Straight to the depths of hell is where those cowards goin'
Well, are you still down? Nigga, holla when you see me
And let these devils be sorry for the day they finally free me
I got a caravan of niggas every time we ride
Hittin' motherfuckers up when we pass by
Until I die, live the life of a boss playa
'Cause even when I'm high, fuck with me and get crossed later
The futures in my eyes,'cause all I want is cash and thangs
A five-double-oh Benz, flauntin' flashy rings
Uhh, bitches pursue me like a dream
Been known to disappear before your eyes just like a dope fiend
It seems, my main thang was to be major paid
The game sharper than a motherfuckin' razor blade
Say money bring bitches, bitches bring lies
One nigga's gettin' jealous, and motherfuckers die
Depend on me like the first and fifteenth
They might hold me for a second, but these punks won't get me
We got four niggas, in low riders and ski masks
Screamin' THUG LIFE every time they pass; all eyes on me
Live the life of a thug nigga
Until the day I die
Live the life of a boss playa
All eyes on me
'Cause even gettin' high
All eyes on me
Live the life of a thug nigga
Until the day I die
Live the life of a boss playa
'Cause even gettin' high
So much trouble in the world, nigga
Can't nobody feel your pain
The world's changin' everyday, time's movin' fast
My girl said I need a raise, how long will she last? 
I'm caught between my woman and my pistol and my chips
Triple beam, got some smokers on, whistle as I dip
I'm lost in the land, with no plan, livin' life flawless
Crime boss, contraband, let me toss this
Needy hookers got a lot of nerve
Let my bucket swerve, I'm takin' off from the curb
The nervousness neglect make me pack a TEC
Devoted to servin' this, Moët and pay checks
Like Akai satellite, nigga, I'm forever ballin'
It ain't right: parasites, triggers, and fleas crawlin'
Sucker, duck and get busted, no emotion
My devotion is handlin' my business, nigga, keep on coastin'
Where you goin', I been there, came back as lonely, homie
Steady flowin' against the grain, niggas still don't know me
I's about the money in this rap shit, this crap shit
It ain't funny, niggas don't even know how to act, shit
What can I do? What can I say? Is there another way? 
Blunts and gin all day, twenty-fo' parlay
My little homie G, can't you see I'm busta-free? 
Niggas can't stand me; all eyes on me
Live the life of a thug nigga
Until the day I die
Live the life of a boss playa
All eyes on me
'Cause even gettin' high
All eyes on me
Live the life of a thug nigga
Until the day I die
Live the life of a boss playa
'Cause even gettin' high
All eyes on me
The feds is watchin', niggas plottin' to get me
Will I survive? Will I die? Come on, let's picture the possibility
Givin' me charges, lawyers makin' a grip
I told the judge I was raised wrong and that's why I blaze shit
Was hyper as a kid, cold as a teenager
On my mobile, callin' big shots on the scene major
Packin' hundreds in my drawers; fuck the law! 
Bitches, I fuck with a passion, I'm livin' rough and raw
Catchin' cases at a fast rate, ballin' in the fast lane
Hustle'til the mornin', never stopped until the cash came
Live my life as a thug nigga until the day I die
Live my life as a boss playa,'cause even gettin' high
These niggas got me tossin' shit
I put the top down, now it's time to floss my shit
Keep your head up, nigga, make these motherfuckers suffer
Up in the Benz, burnin' rubber
The money is mandatory, the hoes is for the stress
This criminal lifestyle, equipped with a bulletproof vest
Make sure your eyes is on the meal ticket, get your money
Motherfucker, let's get rich and we'll kick it; all eyes on me
Live the life of a thug nigga
Until the day I die
Live the life of a boss playa
All eyes on me
'Cause even gettin' high
All eyes on me
Live the life of a thug nigga
Until the day I die
Live the life of a boss playa
'Cause even gettin' high
All eyes on me
Pay attention, my niggas! See how that shit go? 
Nigga walk up in this motherfucker and it be like, 
Bing! 
Cops, bitches, every-motherfuckin'-body
I got bustas, hoes, and police watchin' a nigga, you know? 
He he he, it's like what they think
I'm walkin' around with some ki's in my pocket or somethin'
They think I'm goin' back to jail, they really on that dope
I know y'all watchin', I know y'all got me in the scopes
I know y'all know this is Thug Life, baby! 
Y'all got me under surveillance, huh? 
All eyes on me, but I'm knowin'

Hey yo storm
Honestly I think I can fuck wit' a motherfucker like you

All up under me, telling me we having gold, in case she gold ringing
When I'm coming home and all of that ol' crazy shit
What type of life I live
Now peep it, here go the secret on how to keep a playa
Some love makin' and homecookin', I'll see you later
It don't take a lot to keep a nigga heart
Must be a lady in the light but real freaky in the dark
Plus I got some enemies, baby, hold my pistol
And wrap your arms around a nigga every time I kiss you
Can you visualize the picture, me and you in ecstasy
Don't be upset, it's good sex, when you next to me
Do you wanna test me, put your tired head on my chest
A thug nigga's in the house, now you can rest
I bet'cha never screamed a nigga's whole name out
And felt the pleasure and the pain
About to fuck the very taste out your mouth
If you call me when you need me
1-800-skypage, when you wanna see me
Cause I can be your man
And, baby, you can be my lady
But you gotta give a nigga space or you'll drive me crazy
Run the streets
You can run the streets with your thugs

Until you get through
I'll be waiting
You can run the streets with your thugs

Yo'Pac, you know I'm 16 strong behind you boo
But I gotta do what I gotta do

You know
Now me and you was cool, but I ain't the one to play the fool
Can't make no money in bed
So ain't no future fuckin' you, I ain't the bitch to love ya
Can't do a damn thang for you, if ya ain't about money
9 times outta 10, I'll ignore you, it's a man's world
But real women make the shit go around
Disrespect and I clown the type of bitch to throw down
Throw up the block cause nothin' stops my chips
I boss play ya with this, then twist you lame tricks
Holler if you understand my plan, ladies
Fuck havin' babies by them shady ass niggas, swearin' he can save me
My strategy's official
Checkin' ya pockets while I tongue kiss ya
Soft as tissue
So my next issue is'how to diss you ? '
They call me Storm from the day I was born
I been known to break the coldest motherfucker,'til his hearts warm

Just cause we bone

Aye a nigga that hang out more
Will come home, and love you better
You feel me sweetheart? 
Let a nigga be free
Don't had a nigga all up on thee
Let him run with his niggas
Let the nigga run the street boo, let him run the streets
I'd rather run the streets to make some mail
And put the game down tight
For these gamin' bitches could get it right
It might be a plan that I'm chosen
Don't get in confusion
Because I'm known for showin' examples how I do it
Thinkin' I'm new to this, because I'm younger
Where I'll only leave you suspicious and to wonder
And at the end I make a come up
Nigga, was raised up off of M.O.B
Fetti over something
That's tellin' me don't run the streets
So tell me am I wrong? 
For tryin' to communicate through a song
I'm up early in the morning, by sunrise I'll be gone
All my homies is waitin' for me
Plottin' on plans that we made and all the fun that it's gonna be
So meet me at 3'
And don't be late nigga
We hangin' out all night while drinkin' straight liquor
I heard it's poppin' at a club
But they say I can't get in, cause I'm dressed like a thug
Until I die
I'll be game related
Got me strivin' for a million, stayin' motivated
Now that we made it
I's a battle just for the big money
I'm livin' wild, no smiles, cause ain't a thing funny
I came up hungry, just a lil' nigga, tryin' to make it
I only got one chance, so I gotta take it
Ya never know when it's all gonna happen

They say
Influenced by crime, addicted to grindin'
Where I can pile up my chips
And niggas call me a timer
I been ballin' since my adolescent years steady climbin'
Man, you motherfuckers don't know nuttin' about no timin'
That's right, that's right boy, start that shit off
I heard a rumor I died, murdered in cold blood dramatized
Pictures of me in my final stage, you know mama cried
But that was fiction, some coward got the story twisted
Like I no longer existed, mysteriously missin'
Although I'm worldwide, baby I ain't hard to find
Where I spend most of my time, my California grind
Watchin' for thievin', I'm cautious, it's like I'm barely breathin'
Puttin' a bullet in motherfuckers, give me a reason
See me and hope I'm intoxicated or slightly faded
You tried to play me, now homicide is my only payment
I'm addicted to currency in this life I lead
Why the fuck you cowards be runnin', too scared to fight a G? 
For the life of me, I cannot see
How motherfuckers picture livin' life after a night of fuckin' around with me
And if you don't like this rhyme
Then bring your big bad ass to California,'cause we ain't hard to find
Influenced by crime, addicted to grindin'
Where I can pile up my chips
And niggas call me a timer
I been ballin' since my adolescent years steady climbin'
Motherfuckers don't know nuttin' about no timin'
I got my locs on, hard hat, goin' to war
Breakin' them off on sight, stoppin' lives like red lights
Watch'em pause as I pull my strap out my drawers
And get to dumpin' on they ass like the last outlaw
Rich, 2Pac and The Click, smokin' blunts, loadin' clips
With enough shit to raise your block in one dip
We bring on horror like Tales From the Crypt
And we ain't hard to find is the tales that we kick
I'm fully automatic, full of static and shit
Movin' Dodge van, fifty rounds in the clip
I'm ridin' shotgun with the tint in the back
I'm plan to have a motherfuckin' mint in this rap
I'm from the V-A-L-L-E-J-O
Where sellin' narcotics is all I know
I got blow, speed, and weed, whatever yo' kind
And if you need a motherfucker, I ain't hard to find
Some may call me bootsy, but I call it timin'
That's while I keeps on grindin' 
To the point where a nigga can't stop
Too much feelin' this shit, that's why I'm quick to peel a bitch
Whether it's a nigga or a ho, a ho
Get in my way, then that ass gots to go
'Cause a nigga steady plottin'
I serves hit for hit, and motherfuckers keep droppin'
Influenced by crime, addicted to grindin'
Where I can pile up my chips
And niggas call me a timer
I been ballin' since my adolescent years steady climbin'
Man, you motherfuckers don't know nuttin' about no timin'
C-Bo, D-Shot, E-40, Richie Rich
Da Bay, beitch! 
Down the steps
Abandoned broken down apartment complex
Heavy metal weapons they carry, can't be scary
Playboy, what the fuck is a proof without the trauma plate? 
Nigga, what the fuck you got a gun for if you gon' hesitate? 
Best shake and bake all those I-was-finst-to-ask niggas
Motherfuckers-didn't-think-I was-gon'-do-somethin'-ass niggas
Threaten your life, ain't like you love him
Bury your thoughts, take his head fuck him, have at him
I grew up with that nigga
Threw up with that nigga
I hear he tryin' to ride
Double agent for the other side
But now, my Glock be so judgmental
Back seat of a rental
Keep my name out your dental, nigga
If your gum bleedin' and you needin'
More than twenty stitches, you behaved like them bitches
Sideways to the next
Heavy in the game
Check the resident, it's all the same
Nigga, and we ain't hard to find
Hell nah we ain't hard to find
The whole Clickalation fool
Motherfuckers hard to find, right here bitch
Why them niggas actin' like they can't find us? Like they can't see us and like we don't be at the same spots they be at? 
I's the same congregation. Young Pac is back, you know what
I mean? 
Nigga be lookin' all the way when he see you and shit
I's a celebration
Motherfuckers better understand this shit
Young'Pac is back
Ay D-Shot, nigga, can we get paid man? 
Can we just go there and sock this shit up, please? 
Hey, we smokin', and we ain't hard to find
Drinkin' and shit, fuckin' with some Hurricane
A motherfucker's gonna get his marbles regardless, playboy
You supposed to
Sideways to the next light, and to the next coast, poppin' the muthafuckin' most, you understand what I'm sayin'
Money over bitches, nigga, M.O.B., M.O.B
Heaven ain't hard to find
All you gotta do is look
Simply because you nervous, let me start off with my conversation
Hopin' my information, alleviates the hesitation
I can see it clearly now
Catch you smilin' through your frown
I'm askin' baby boo are you down
Although I know you've heard about my reputation
Across the nation, Mr. I-get-around
My temptation got me drippin' wet, perspiration
I'm activated by the moves you're makin'
Baby why you fakin'? Strip naked get tp love makin'
See it's all in your mind, so every time I sip a glass of wine
I fantasize'til that ass is mine
Never gettin' but wantin', never touchin' but wishin'
A straight thug on a mission, until I get what I'm missin'
Stop with the beeper, baby, listen
I know you're grown but pay attention
Let me hypnotize with my tongue kissin'
This is a message to bomb bodies and all dimes
Turn around one more time, heaven ain't hard to find
Hea-ven!
Heaven ain't hard to find
Heaven ain't hard to find
Heaven ain't hard to find
In fact you can have it just have faith
Just like a little kid, still believin' in magic
It takes a lot of sacrifice
With all the lonely nights on tour
I need somebody I can trust in my life
Let me apply the brakes
Baby, you're movin' to fast
My conversations are gettin' deeper, but first let me ask
Are you afraid of a thug? 
And have you ever made love
With candles and bubbles sippin' in your tub ? 
Touch me and let me activate your blood pressure
This thug passion help the average man love better
Picture me naked and glistenin' beneath the moonlight mist
Take a shot of that Alizé, come give me a kiss
And maybe we can be better friends, perhaps we'll be closer
I'll be the thug in your life, baby, and you'll be my soldier
And I know it takes some time and you got a lot of questions on your mind
But relax, in due time
Heaven ain't hard to find
Hea-ven! 
Heaven ain't hard to find
Hea-ven! it ain't hard to find
You think we all dogs, that's why you cautious when I approached you
Been talkin' since you arrived, but not a word is spoken
Through my eye contact I wink and you respond back
Lookin' mean, what's all that? 
I's like the closer you get
Baby, the quicker I'm speakin'
I got a flight out to Cabo
Let's kick it this weekend
I'm sippin' Hennessy and Coke
Though addicted to weed smoke
I'm fiendin' for your body even mo'
Oh God, help me, identify me truest thoughts
Your hidden motives full of passion
Who would have thought? 
Come holler at me baby, love me for my thug nature
Far from a playa hater, label me a money maker, 
Straight heart breaker
Baby we can be friends, I can soup you in my Benz
We'll ride, I'll let you floss it for your friends
Once we begin
Until the end, it gets better with time
I'm makin' love to your mind, baby
Heaven ain't hard to find
Hea-ven! Hea-ven, it ain't hard to find
Heaven ain't hard to find
Heaven ain't hard to find nice glass of Alize
Hea-ven! Hea-ven! Hea-ven, Heaven

Curtis Mayfield
Sugarhill Gang
God damnit Voletta, what the fuck are you doin? 
You can't control that god damn boy? 
I just saw Mr. Johnson, he told me he caught the motherfucking boy shoplifting
You can't control the god, I don't know what the fuck to do with that boy
If if you can't fucking control him
Bitch, what I say, I'mma send his motherfuckin ass to a group home goddamnit, what? 
I'll smack the shit outta you bitch
Motherfucker, you are fucking up
Back in the day
Things done changed on this side
Remember they used to thump but now they blast, right
Remember back in the days when niggas had waves
Cazal shades and corn braids
Pitching pennies, honeys had the high-top jellies
Shooting skelly, motherfuckers was all friendly
Lounging at the barbecues, drinking brews
With the neighborhood crews, hanging on the avenues
Turn your pages to 1993
Niggas is getting smoked, G: believe me
Talk slick, you get your neck slit quick
Cause real street niggas ain't having that shit
Toting Tecs for rep
Smoking blunts in the project hallways
Shooting dice all day
Wait for niggas to step up on some fighting shit
We get hype and shit and start lighting shit
So step away with your fist-fight ways
Motherfucker, this ain't back in the days
But you don't hear me though
Back in the day
Things done changed on this side
Remember they used to thump but now they blast, right
No more coco-levio 1, 2, 3
1, 2, 3... all it is to me, is a mystery
I hear you motherfuckers talk about it
But I stay seeing bodies with the motherfucking chalk around it
And I'm down with the shit too
For the stupid motherfuckers want to try to use Kung-Fu
Instead of a MAC-10, he tried scrapping
Slugs in his back and that's what the fuck happens
When you sleep on the street
Little motherfuckers with heat wanna leave a nigga six feet deep
And we coming to the wake
To make sure the crying and commotion ain't a motherfucking fake
Back in the days our parents used to take care of us
Look at'em now, they even fuckin' scared of us
Calling the city for help because they can't maintain
Damn, shit done changed
Back in the day
Things done changed on this side
Remember they used to thump but now they blast, right
If I wasn't in the rap game
I'd probably have a key knee-deep in the crack game
Because the streets is a short stop
Either you're slinging crack rock or you got a wicked jump shot
Shit, it's hard being young from the slums
Eating 5 cent gums, not knowing where your meal's coming from
And now the shit's getting crazier and major
Kids younger than me, they got the Sky brand pagers
Going out of town, blowing up
Six months later, all the dead bodies showing up
It make me wanna grab the 9 and the shotty
But I gotta go identify the body
Damn, what happened to the summertime cookouts
Every time I turn around, a nigga getting took out
Shit, my Momma got cancer in her breast
Don't ask me why I'm motherfucking stressed, things done changed
Back in the day
Things done changed on this side
Remember they used to thump but now they blast, right
Yeah, mothafuckas better know
I'm a bad bad bad
Lock your windows, close your doors
Biggie Smalls
My man Inf left a Tec and a 9 at my crib
Turned his self in, he had to do a bid
A 1-to-3, he be home the end of'93
I'm ready to get this paper, G: you with me? 
Motherfucking right, my pockets looking kinda tight
And I'm stressed
Yo, Biggie let me get the vest
No need for that, just grab the fucking gat
The first pocket that's fat, the Tec is to his back
Word is bond, I'mma smoke him, yo, don't fake no moves 
Treat it like boxing, stick and move, stick and move
Nigga, you ain't got to explain shit
I've been robbing motherfuckas since the slave ships
With the same clip and the same.45
Two point blank, a motherfucker sure to die
That's my word, nigga even try to bogard
Have his mother singing, it's so hard
Yes love, love your fucking attitude
Because the nigga play pussy, that's the nigga that's getting screwed
And bruised up from the pistol whipping
Welts on the neck from the necklace stripping
Then I'm dipping up the block and I'm robbing bitches too
Up the herringbones and bamboos
I wouldn't give a fuck if you're pregnant
Give me the baby rings and the #1 Mom pendant
I'm slamming niggas like Shaquille, shit is real
When it's time to eat a meal, I rob and steal
Cause mom dukes ain't giving me shit
So for the bread and butter I leave niggas in the gutter
Huh, word to mother, I'm dangerous
Crazier than a bag of fucking angel dust
When I bust my Gat, mothafuckas take dirt naps
I'm all that, and a dime sack, where the paper at? 
When he's sticking you and taking all of your money
Gimme the loot, gimme the loot 
Gimme the loot, gimme the loot 
Gimme the loot, gimme the loot 
Gimme the loot, gimme the loot 
Gimme the loot, gimme the loot 
Gimme the loot, gimme the loot 
Gimme the loot, gimme the loot 
Gimme the loot, gimme the loot 
Big up, big up, it's a stick up, stick up
And I'm shooting niggas quick if ya hiccup
Don't let me fill my clip up in ya back and headpiece
The opposite of peace, sending Mom duke a wreath
You're talking to the robbery expert
Step into your wake with your blood on my shirt
Don't be a jerk and get smoked over being resistant
Cause when I lick shots, them shits is persistent
Goodness gracious, the papers! 
Where the cash at? Where the stash at? 
Nigga pass that
Before you get your grave dug from the main thug.357 slug
And my nigga Biggie got a itchy one grip
One in the chamber, thirty-two in the clip
Motherfuckas better strip, 
Before you find out how blue steel feel
From the Beretta, putting all the holes in ya sweater
The money-getter, motherfuckas don't know better
Rolex watches and colorful Swatches
I'm digging in pockets, motherfuckas can't stop it
Man niggas come through I'm taking high school rings too
Bitches get strangled for their earrings and bangles
And when I rock her and drop her, I'm taking her doorknockers
And if she's resistant: blakka, blakka, blakka
So go get your man bitch, he can get robbed too
Tell him Biggie took it, what the fuck he gonna do? 
Man I hope apologetic or I'm a have to set it
And if I set it, the cocksucker won't forget it
Hey bitch, hey bitch, gimme your money bitch 
Gimme the loot, gimme the loot 
Gimme the loot, gimme the loot 
Gimme the loot, gimme the loot 
Gimme the loot, gimme the loot 
Gimme the loot, gimme the loot 
Gimme the loot, gimme the loot 
Gimme the loot, gimme the loot 
Gimme the loot, gimme the loot 
Man listen, all this walking is hurting my feet
Ooh money looks sweet
Where? 
In the Isuzu jeep
Man, I throw him in the fiend you grab the fucking cream
And if he start to scream, bom bom, have a nice dream
Hold up, he got a fucking bitch in the car
Fur coats and diamonds, she think she a superstar
Ooh Biggie let me jack her, I'll kick her in the back
Hit her with the Gat
Yo chill shorty, let me do that
Just get the fucking car keys and cruise up the block
The bitch act shocked getting shot on the spot
Oh shit the cops
Be cool, fool
They ain't gonna roll up, all they want is fucking doughnuts
So why the fuck he keep looking? 
I guess to get his life tooken
I just came home, ain't trying to see central booking
Oh shit, now he looking in my face
You better haul ass cause I ain't with no fucking chase
So lace up your boots, cause I'm about to shoot
A true motherfucka going out for the loot
Take that motherfuckers
Damn, is that the Chronic? 
Yeah, it's that chronic boy
So you wanna be hardcore with your hat to the back
Talking about the gats in your raps
But I can't feel that hardcore appeal that you're screaming
Maybe I'm dreaming
This ain't Christopher Williams, still some
MC's got to feel one, caps I got to peel some
To let niggas know that if you fuck with big-and-heavy
I get up in that ass like a wedgie
Says who, says me the lyrical
Niggas saying, 
Biggie off the street, it's a miracle! 
Left the drugs alone, took the thugs along with me
Just for niggas acting shifty
Sticks and stones break bones but the gat'll kill you quicker
Especially when I'm drunk off the liquor
Smoking funk by the boxes, packing Glockses
I's natural to eat you niggas like chocolates
The funk, baby
I live for the funk, I'll die for the funk
I live for the funk, I'll die for the funk
I live for the funk, I'll die for the funk
I live for the funk, I'll die for the funk
I live for the funk, I'll die for the funk
I live for the funk, I'll die for the funk
I live for the funk, I'll die for the funk
I live for the funk, I'll die for the funk
All I want is bitches, big-booty bitches
Used to sell crack so I could stack my riches
Now I pack gats to stop all the snitches
From staying in my business, what is this? 
Relentless approach to know if I'm broke or not
Just cause I joke and smoke a lot, don't mean I don't tote the Glock
Sixteen shots for my niggas in the pen
Until we motherfucking meet again
I'm doing rhymes now, fuck the crimes now
Come on the ave, I'm real hard to find now
'Cause I'm knee-deep in the beats
In the Land Cruiser Jeep with the MAC-10 by the seats
For the jackers, the jealous-ass crackers in the 
I'll make you prove that it's bulletproof
Hold your head'cause when you hit the bricks
I got gin, mad blunts, and bitches sucking dick
The funk, baby
I live for the funk, I'll die for the funk
I live for the funk, I'll die for the funk
I live for the funk, I'll die for the funk
I live for the funk, I'll die for the funk
I live for the funk, I'll die for the funk
I live for the funk, I'll die for the funk
I live for the funk, I'll die for the funk
I live for the funk, I'll die for the funk
So I guess you know the story, the rap-side, crack-side
How I smoked funk, smacked bitches on the backside
Bed-Stuy, the place where my head rests
Fifty-shot clip if a nigga want test
The rocket launcher, Biggie stomped ya
High as a motherfucking helicopter
That's why I pack a Nina, fuck a misdemeanor
Beating motherfuckers like Ike beat Tina
What's love got to do? 
When I'm ripping all through your whole crew
Strapped like Bamboo but I don't sling guns
I got bags of funk and it's selling by the tons
Niggas want to know how I live the mack life
Making money, smoking mics like crack pipes
I's type simple and plain to maintain
I add a little funk to the brain
The funk, baby
I live for the funk, I'll die for the funk
I live for the funk, I'll die for the funk
I live for the funk, I'll die for the funk
I live for the funk, I'll die for the funk
I live for the funk, I'll die for the funk
I live for the funk, I'll die for the funk
I live for the funk, I'll die for the funk
I live for the funk, I'll die for the funk"
Who the fuck is this? Paging me at 5:46
In the morning, crack of dawn and
Now I'm yawning, wipe the cold out my eye
See who's this paging me and why? 
I's my nigga, Pop, from the barbershop
Told me he was in the gambling spot and heard the intricate plot
Of niggas wanna stick me like flypaper, neighbor
Slow down love, please chill, drop the caper
Remember them niggas from the hill up in Brownsville
That you rolled dice with, smoked blunts and got nice with? 
Yeah my nigga Fame up in Prospect
Nah them my niggas nah love wouldn't disrespect
I didn't say them, they schooled me to some niggas
That you knew from back when, when you was clocking minor figures
Now they heard you're blowing up like nitro
And they wanna stick the knife through your windpipe slow
So, thank Fame for warning me cause now I'm warning you
I got the Mac, nigga tell me what you gonna do
Damn, niggas wanna stick me for my paper
Damn, niggas wanna stick me for my paper
Damn, niggas wanna stick me for my paper
Damn, niggas wanna stick me for my paper
They heard about the Rolexes and the Lexus
With the Texas license plates out of state
They heard about the pounds you got down in Georgetown
And they heard you got half of Virginia locked down
They even heard about the crib you bought your moms out in Florida
The Fifth Corridor
Call the coroner! 
There's gonna be a lot of slow singing and flower bringing
If my burglar alarm starts ringing
What ya think all the guns is for? 
All-purpose war, got the Rottweilers by the door
And I feed em gunpowder, so they can devour
The criminals trying to drop my decimals
Damn, niggas wanna stick me for my cream
And it ain't a dream, things ain't always what it seem
I's the ones that smoke blunts with ya, see your picture
Now they wanna grab they guns and come and get ya
Bet ya Biggie won't slip
I got the Calico with the black talons loaded in the clip
So I can rip through the ligaments
Put the fuckers in a bad predicament, where all the foul niggas went
Touch my cheddar, feel my Beretta
Buck! What I'mma hit you with you motherfuckers better duck
I bring pain, bloodstains on what remains
Of his jacket - he had a gun he shoulda packed it
Cocked it, extra clips in my pocket
So I can reload and explode on you rasshole
I fuck around and get hardcore
C-4 to your door, no beef no more nigga
Feel the rough, scandalous
The more weed smoke I puff, the more dangerous
I don't give a fuck about you or your weak crew
What you gonna do when Big Poppa comes for you? 
I'm not running, nigga I bust my gun and
Hold on, I hear somebody coming
Yeah, you ready motherfucker? 
We gonna kill your ass
As I grab the Glock, put it to your headpiece
One in the chamber, the safety is off release
Straight at your dome, holmes, I wanna see cabbage
Biggie Smalls the savage, doing your brain cells much damage
Teflon is the material for the imperial
Mic ripper, girl stripper, the Henny sipper
I drop lyrics off and on like a lightswitch
Quick to grab the right bitch and make her drive
The Q-45, Glocks and tecs are expected when I wreck shit
Respect is collected, so check it
I got techniques dripping out my buttcheeks
Sleep on my stomach so I don't fuck up my sheets, huh
My shit is deep, deeper than my grave, G
I'm ready to die and nobody can save me
Fuck the world, fuck my moms and my girl
My life is played out like a Jheri curl, I'm ready to die! 
As I sit back and look when I used to be a crook
Doing whatever it took from snatching chains to pocketbooks
A big bad motherfucker on the wrong road
I got some drugs, tried to get the avenue sewed
I want it all from the Rolexes to the Lexus
Getting paid is all I expected
My mother didn't give me what I want, what the fuck? 
Now I've got a Glock making motherfuckers duck
Shit is real, and hungry's how I feel
I rob and steal because that money got that whip appeal
Kicking niggas down the steps just for rep
Any repercussion lead to niggas getting wet
The infrared's at your head real steady
You better grab your guns cause I'm ready, ready
I'm ready to die! 
Nah we ain't gonna kill your ass yet
We gonna make you suffer
In a sec, I throw the tec to your fucking neck
Everybody hit the deck, Biggie bout to get some rec
Quick to leave you in a coffin, for slick talking
You better act like Ce
Ce and keep on walking
When I hit ya, I split ya to the white meat
You swung a left, you swung a right, you fell to the concrete
Your face, my feet, they meet, with stompin'
I'm rippin MC's from Tallahassee, to Compton
Biggie Smalls on a higher plane
Niggas say I'm strange deranged because I put the 12 gauge to your brain
Make your shit splatter
Mix the blood like batter then my pocket gets fatter
After the hit, leave you on the street with your neck split
Down your backbone to where your motherfucking cheek drip
The shit I kick, ripping through the vest
Biggie Smalls passing any test, I'm ready to die! 
I'm ready
Niggas definitely know what time it is
The Notorious one in full effect
For ninety-three! 
Suicidal, I'm ready! 
Yeah
When it comes to sex, I’m similar to the Thrilla in Manila
Honeys call me 
Bigga the Condom Filler
Whether it’s stiff tongue or stiff dick
Biggie squeeze it to make shit fit, now check this shit
I got the pack of Rough Riders in the back of the Pathfinder
You know the epilogue by James Todd Smith
I get swift with the lyrical gift
Hit you with a dick, make your kidney shift
Here we go, here we go, but I’m not Domino
I got the funk flow to make your drawers drop slow
So recognize the dick size in these Karl Kani jeans
I wear thirteens, know what I mean? 
I’ll fuck around and hit you with the Hennessy dick
Mess around and go blind, don’t get to see shit
The next batter, here to shatter your bladder
It doesn’t matter: skinny or fat or light-skinned or black
Baby, I drop these Boricua mamis screaming ¡ay papi! 
I love it when they call me Big Poppa
I only smoke blunts if they rolled proper
Look, I gotcha caught up with the drunk flow
Fuck tae kwon do, I tote a.44
For niggas getting mad cause they bitch chose me
A big black motherfucker with G
You see, all I do is separate the game from the truth
Big bang boots from the Bronx to Bolivia
Getting physical like Olivia Newt
Tricks suck my clique dick all day with no trivia
So give me a ho, a bankroll and a bag of weed:
I’m guaranteed to fuck her ’til her nose bleed
Even if your new man’s a certified mack
You’ll get that H-Town in ya: you want that old thing back
Oh, Biggie, give me one more chance
I got that good dick, girl, you didn’t know? 
Oh, Biggie, give me one more chance
I got that good dick, girl, you didn’t know? 
Oh, Biggie, give me one more chance
I got that good dick, girl, you didn’t know? 
Oh, Biggie, give me one more chance
Is my mind playing tricks, like Scarface and Bushwick
Willie D, having nightmares of girls killing me
She mad because what we had didn’t last
I’m glad because her cousin let me hit the ass
Fuck the past: let’s dwell on the 500SL, the E&J and ginger ale
The way my pockets swell to the rims with benjamins
Another honey’s in the crib? Please, send her in
I fuck non-stop, lick my lips a lot
Used to lick the clits a lot, but licking clits had to stop
‘Cause y’all don’t know how to act when the tongue go down below
Peep the funk flow
Really, though, I got the cleanest, meanest penis
You never seen this stroke of genius
So take off your Tim boots and your body suit
I mean the spandex -- and hit my man next
Sex get rougher when it come to the nut buster
Pussy crusher, black nasty motherfucker
I don’t chase'em, I replace'em
And if I’m caressing'em I’m undressing'em
Fuck what you heard, who’s the best in New York
Fulfilling fantasies without that nigga Mr. Roarke or Tattoo
I got you wrapped around my dick and when I nut I got to split
Backshots is my position, I got you wishing for an intermission
Fuck the kissin'
Lick you down to your belly button, I ain’t frontin’
They don’t call me big for nuttin’ all of a sudden
Oh, Biggie, give me one more chance
Oh, Biggie, give me one more chance
Oh, Biggie, give me one more chance
Oh, Biggie, give me one more chance
Uuh, yeah, uh, oooh, oh yeah, mmm, yeah
Oh fuck me you black mothafucka, oooohh yeah! ! ! MMMMMM, Aaahhh
Oh fuck me you black Kentucky Fried Chicken eatin'
Ohhh, ooohhh, yeah

OOOHHHHH

Biggie! 
Oh yeah
 I'm sorry
 Ahhhh....
 Oh shit. Damn
  Jenny Craig eatin' muthafucka
  Fuck you bitch...
  I used to get feels on a bitch
Now I throw shields on the dick, to stop me from that HIV shit
And niggas know they soft like a Twinkie filling
Playing the villain, prepare for this rap killing
Biggie Smalls is the illest, your style is played out
Like Arnold and that, what you talkin' bout Willis
The thrill is gone, the Black Frank White
Is here to excite and throw dick to dykes
Bitches I like em brainless, guns I like em stainless steel
I want the fucking Fortune like the Wheel
I squeeze Gats till my clips is empty
Don't tempt me
You don't want to fuck with the M-E...
...T-H-O-D Man, here I am
I'll be damned if this ain't some shit
Come to spread the butter lyrics over harmony grit
I's the low killer death trap, yes I'm a jet-black ninja
Coming where you rest at, surrender
Step inside the ring, you's the number one contender
Looking cold-booty like your pussy in December
Nigga stop bitching, button up your lip and
From Method all you getting is a can of ass-whipping
Hey, I'll be kicking, you son, you doing all the yapping
Acting as if it can't happen
Your frontin' got me mad enough to touch something
Yo I'm from Shaolin Island and ain't afraid to bust something
So what you want nigga, you won't nigga
I got a 6-shooter and a horse named Trigger
I's real,'94 rugged-raw
Kicking down your goddamn door
Fuck the world, don't ask me for shit
Everything you get you gotta work hard for it
Honeys shake your hips, you don't stop
And niggas pack the clips, keep on, bitch
Verse two, coming with that Olde E brew
Meth-tical, putting niggas back in I.C.U
I'm lifted troop, you can bring your wack-ass crew
I got connections, I'll get that ass stuck like glue
Huh, no question, I be coming down and shit
Yo I gets rugged as a motherfucking carpet get
And niggas love it, not in the physical form but in the mental
I spark and they cells get warm
I'm not a gentle-man, I'm a Method Man
Baby accept it, utmost respect it, and
 
 Stop look and listen
I spit on your grave then I grab my Charles Dickens
Bitch
Welcome to my center, honeys feel it deep in they placenta
Cold as the pole in the Winter
Far from the inventor, but I got this rap shit sewed
And when my Mac unloads I'm guaranteed another video
Ready to die, why I act that way? 
Pop Duke left Mom Duke, the faggot took the back way
So instead of making hoes suck my dick up
I used to do stick-ups, cause hoes is irritating like the hiccups
Excuse me, flows just grow through me
Like trees to branches, cliffs to avalanches
I's the praying mantis, deep like the mind of Farrakhan
A motherfucking rap phenomenon, plus
 I got more Glocks and Tecs than you
 I make it hot
 niggas won't even stand next to you
 Nigga touch me you better bust me three times in the head
Or motherfucker's dead, you thought so
Fuck the world, don't ask me for shit
Everything you get you gotta work hard for it
Honeys shake your hips, you don't stop
And niggas pack the clips, keep on, bitch
Fuck the world, don't ask me for shit
Everything you get you gotta work hard for it
Honeys shake your hips, you don't stop
And niggas pack the clips, keep on, bitch
Junior M.A.F.I.A. clique in full effect
Ah, yeah, hell yeah 
Bedford–Stuyvesant the livest one
My borough is thorough, recognize
Fuck all you hoes! Get a grip, motherfucker! 
Yeah, this album is dedicated
To all the teachers that told me I'd never amount to nothin'
To all the people that lived above the buildings that I was hustlin' in front of
Called the police on me when I was just tryin' to make some money to feed my daughter
And all the niggas in the struggle
You know what I'm sayin'? I's all good, baby baby
It was all a dream, I used to read Word Up! magazine
Salt-n-Pepa and Heavy D up in the limousine
Hangin' pictures on my wall
Every Saturday Rap Attack, Mr. Magic, Marley Marl
I let my tape rock'til my tape popped
Smokin' weed on Bambu, sippin' on Private Stock
Way back, when I had the red and black lumberjack
With the hat to match
Remember Rappin' Duke? Duh-ha, duh-ha
You never thought that hip hop would take it this far
Now I'm in the limelight'cause I rhyme tight
Time to get paid, blow up like the World Trade
Born sinner, the opposite of a winner
Remember when I used to eat sardines for dinner
Peace to Ron G, Brucie B, Kid Capri
Funkmaster Flex, Lovebug Starski
I'm blowin' up like you thought I would
Call the crib, same number, same hood
I's all good 
And if you don't know, now you know, nigga
You know very well
Who you are
Don't let'em hold you down
Reach for the stars
You had a goal
But not that many
'Cause you're the only one
I'll give you good and plenty
I made the change from a common thief
To up close and personal with Robin Leach
And I'm far from cheap
I smoke skunk with my peeps all day
Spread love, it's the Brooklyn way
The Moët and Alizé keep me pissy
Girls used to diss me
Now they write letters'cause they miss me
I never thought it could happen, this rappin' stuff
I was too used to packin' gats and stuff
Now honeys play me close like butter play toast
From the Mississippi down to the East Coast
Condos in Queens, indo for weeks
Sold-out seats to hear Biggie Smalls speak
Livin' life without fear
Puttin' five carats in my baby girl's ear
Lunches, brunches, interviews by the pool
Considered a fool'cause I dropped out of high school
Stereotypes of a black male misunderstood
And it's still all good
And if you don't know, now you know, nigga
You know very well
Who you are
Don't let'em hold you down
Reach for the stars
You had a goal
But not that many
'Cause you're the only one
I'll give you good and plenty
Super Nintendo, Sega Genesis
When I was dead broke, man, I couldn't picture this
50-inch screen, money-green leather sofa
Got two rides, a limousine with a chauffeur
Phone bill about two G's flat
No need to worry, my accountant handles that
And my whole crew is loungin'
Celebratin' every day, no more public housin'
Thinkin' back on my one-room shack
Now my mom pimps a Ac' with minks on her back
And she loves to show me off of course
Smiles every time my face is up in The Source
We used to fuss when the landlord dissed us
No heat, wonder why Christmas missed us
Birthdays was the worst days
Now we sip Champagne when we thirsty
Uh, damn right, I like the life I live
'Cause I went from negative to positive
And it's all… 
And if you don't know, now you know, nigga
You know very well
Who you are
Don't let'em hold you down
And if you don't know, now you know, nigga
Reach for the stars
You had a goal
But not that many
'Cause you're the only one
I'll give you good and plenty
And if you don't know, now you know, nigga
Representin' B-Town in the house
Junior Mafia, mad flavor
Uh, uh, yeah, a'ight
You know very well
Who you are
Don't let'em hold you down
Reach for the stars
You had a goal
But not that many
'Cause you're the only one
I'll give you good and plenty
Biggie Smalls, it's all good, nigga
Junior Mafia, it's all good, nigga
Bad Boy, it's all good, nigga
I's all good
That's right,'94
And on and on, and on and on
You know very well
I's all good
Who you are
Yeah…
Don't let'em hold you down
Reach for the stars
I don't wanna live no more
Sometimes I hear death knocking at my front door
I'm living every day like a hustle
Another drug to juggle, another day, another struggle
I don't wanna live no more
Sometimes I hear death knocking at my front door
I'm living every day like a hustle
Another drug to juggle, another day, another struggle
I know how it feel to wake up fucked up
Pockets broke as hell, another rock to sell
People look at you like you's the user
Selling drugs to all the losers, mad buddha abuser
But they don't know about your stress-filled day
Baby on the way, mad bills to pay
That's why you drink Tanqueray, so you can reminisce
And wish you wasn't living so devilish, shit
I remember I was just like you
Smoking blunts with my crew, flippin' over 62's
‘Cause G-E-D wasn't B-I-G
I got P-A-I-D, that's why my moms hate me
She was forced to kick me out, no doubt
Then I figured out nicks went for 20 down South
Packed up my tools for my raw power move
Glock 19 for casket and flower moves
For chumps tryin' to stop my flow
And what they don't know will show on the autopsy
Went to see Papi to cop me a brick
Asked for some consignment and he wasn't tryin' to hear it
Smoking mad Newports ‘cause I'm due in court
For an assault that I caught in Bridgeport, New York
Catch me if you can like the Gingerbread Man
You better have your gat in hand, ‘cause man…
I don't wanna live no more
Sometimes I hear death knocking at my front door
I'm living every day like a hustle
Another drug to juggle, another day, another struggle
I don't wanna live no more
Sometimes I hear death knocking at my front door
I'm living every day like a hustle
Another drug to juggle, another day, another struggle
I had the master plan, I'm in the caravan on my way to Maryland, with my man Two-TEC's to take over this projects
They call him Two-TEC's, he tote two TEC's
And when he start to bust, he like to ask, 
Who's next? 
I got my honey on the Amtrak with the crack
In the crack of her ass, two pounds of hash in the stash
I wait for hon to make some quick cash
I told her she could be lieutenant, bitch got gassed
At last, I'm literally lounging, black
Sitting back, counting double digit thousand stacks
Had to re-up, see what's up with my peeps
Toyota Deal-a-Thon had it cheap on the Jeeps
See who got smoked, what rumors was spread
Last I heard I was dead with six to the head
Then I got the phone call, it couldn't hit me harder
We got infiltrated, like Nino at the Carter
Heard Tec got murdered in a town I never heard of
By some bitch named Alberta over nickel-plated burners
And my bitch, swear to God she won't snitch
I told her when she hit the bricks, I'll make the hooker rich
Conspiracy, she'll be home in three
Until then I looks out for the whole family; a true G, that's me
Blowing like a bubble in the everyday struggle
I don't wanna live no more
Sometimes I hear death knocking at my front door
I'm living every day like a hustle
Another drug to juggle, another day, another struggle
I don't wanna live no more
Sometimes I hear death knocking at my front door
I'm living every day like a hustle
Another drug to juggle, another day, another struggle
I'm seeing body after body and our mayor Giuliani
Ain't tryin' to see no black man turn to John Gotti
My daughter use a potty so she's older now
Educated street knowledge, I'mma mould her now
Trick a little dough buying young girls fringes
Dealing with the dope fiend binges, seeing syringes
In the veins, hard to explain how I maintain
The crack smoke make my brain feel so strange
Breaking days on the set, no sweat
Drunk off Moet, can't bag yet because it's still wet
But when that dry, bagging five at a time
I can clock about nine on the check cashing line
I had the first and the third, rehearse, that's my word
Thick in the game, D's knew my first name
Should I quit? Shit no, even though they had me scared
Yo, they got a eight, I got a TEC with air holes
And that's just how the shit go in the struggle, mothafucka
Hah, come on, what you say? 
I don't wanna live no more
Sometimes I hear death knocking at my front door
I'm living every day like a hustle
Another drug to juggle, another day, another struggle
I don't wanna live no more
Sometimes I hear death knocking at my front door
I'm living every day like a hustle
Another drug to juggle, another day, another struggle
I don't wanna live no more
Sometimes I hear death knocking at my front door
I'm living every day like a hustle
Another drug to juggle, another day, another struggle
I don't wanna live no more
Sometimes I hear death knocking at my front door
I'm living every day like a hustle
Another drug to juggle, another day, another struggle
Junior M.A.F.I.A. right
Yeah, rock on
Biggie Smalls, right
Junior M.A.F.I.A
Yo let—let—let me ask you a question yo
Yo, would you kill for me? 
Hmmm... yeah
What took you so long to answer motherfucker? 
I don't know
The fuck wrong with you bitch? 
When I met you I admit my first thoughts was to trick
You look so good huh, I suck on your daddy's dick
I never felt that way in my life
It didn't take long before I made you my wife
Got no rings and shit, just my main squeeze
Comin' to the crib, even had a set a keys
During the days you helped me bag up my nickels
In the process, I admit, I tricked a little
But you was my bitch, the one who'd never snitch
Love me when I'm broke or when I'm filthy fuckin' rich
And I admit, when the time is right, the wine is right
I treat you right, you talk slick, I beat you right
Just me and my bitch, me and my bitch
Just me and my bitch, uh, just me and my bitch
Just me and my bitch, just me and my bitch
Just me and my bitch, just me and my bitch
Just me and my bitch, just me and my bitch
Yeah, just me and my bitch 
Just me and my bitch, me and my bitch
Just me and my bitch
But you know you love that ass, don't you? 
Yeah, no question
No question
Yo, let me ask you another question
What? 
You been fuckin''round on me? 
Why would I do that? 
Yo, don't lie to me motherfucker
Moonlight strolls with the hoes, oh no, that's not my steelo
I wanna bitch that like to play ceelo, and craps
Packin gats, in a Coach bag steamin dime bags
A real bitch is all I want, all I ever had
With a bop just as strong as me
Totin guns just as long as me, the bitch belongs with me
Any plans with another bitch, my bitch'll spoil it
One day, she used my toothbrush to clean the toilet 
Throwin my clothes out the windows, so when the wind blows
I see my Polos and Timbos
Hide my car keys so I can't leave
A real slick bitch, keep a trick up her sleeve
And if I deceive, she won't take it lightly
She'll invite me, politely, to fight, G
And then we lie together, cry together
I swear to God I hope we fuckin' die together
Just me and my bitch, just me and my bitch
Just me and my bitch, just me and my bitch
Just me and my bitch, just me and my bitch
Just me and my bitch, just me and my bitch
Just me and my bitch, just me and my bitch
Just me and my bitch, just me and my bitch
Just me and my bitch, just me and my bitch
Just me and my bitch, yeah
Let me tell you nigga, if I ever
Ever catch your ass fuckin' around
I'ma cut your mother-fuckin' dick off
Hah, heheh stop playin, hah
I ain't playin, ain't no jokes, ain't no jokes
Ain't no jokes
Yo, don- don't play with my dick
She helped me plan out my robberies on my enemies
Didn't hesitate to squeeze, to get my life out of danger
One day, she put 911 on the pager
Had to call back, whether it's minor or major
No response, the phone just rung
Grab my vest, grab my gun, to find out the problem
When I pulled up, police was on the scene
Had to make the U-turn, make sure my shit was clean
Drove down the block, stashed the burner in the bushes
Stepped to police with the shoves and the pushes
It didn't take long before the tears start
I saw my bitch dead with the gunshot to the heart
And I know it was meant for me
I guess the niggas felt they had to kill the closest one to me
And when I find'em your life is to an end
They killed my best friend... me and my bitch
Just me and my bitch, me and my bitch
Just me and my, just me and my bitch, uh
Just me and my bitch, me and my bitch
Just me and my, just me and my bitch, uh 
Just me and my bitch, just me and my bitch
Yeah, just me and my bitch 
Just me and my bitch, me and my bitch
Just me and my bitch
So when did you first start rappin'? 
Um, I was like about 18 years old. Yeah, about 18…
So how did you first get started? Who influenced you? 
Ain’t nobody influenced me, you know what I’m saying?
I was just tired of being on the streets, you know what I’m saying?
Had to get up off that, you know
I see. So where you from? 
Brooklyn
Uh, uh, check it out , uh
Junior M.A.F.I.A., uh 
Uh  yeah, yeah
Nine-fo' 
To all the ladies in the place with style and grace
Allow me to lace these lyrical douches in your bushes
Who rock grooves and make moves with all the mamis? 
The back of the club, sippin' Moët is where you'll find me
The back of the club, mackin' hoes, my crew's behind me
Mad question askin', blunt passin'
Music blastin', but I just can't quit
Because one of these honeys Biggie got to creep with
Sleep with, keep the ep a secret, why not? 
Why blow up my spot cause we both got hot? 
Now check it: I got more mack than Craig, and in the bed
Believe me, sweetie, I got enough to feed the needy
No need to be greedy, I got mad friends with Benzes
C-notes by the layers, true fuckin' players
Jump in the Rover and come over
Tell your friends jump in the GS3, I got the chronic by the tree
I love it when you call me big poppa
Throw your hands in the air if you's a true player
I love it when you call me big poppa
To the honies getting money
Playing niggas like dummies
I love it when you call me big poppa
If you got a gun up in your waist
Please don't shoot up the place! 
‘Cause I see some ladies tonight
That should be having my baby, baby
Straight up, honey, really I'm askin'
Most of these niggas think they be mackin', but they be actin'
Who they attractin' with that line
What's your name? What's your sign? 
Soon as he buy that wine, I just creep up from behind
And ask what your interests are, who you be with
Things that make you smile, what numbers to dial
You gon' be here for a while? 
I'm gon' go call my crew, you go call your crew
We can rendezvous at the bar around 2
Plans to leave, throw the keys to Lil Cease
Pull the truck up front, and roll up the next blunt
So we can steam on the way to the telly, go fill my belly
A T-bone steak, cheese eggs and Welch's grape
Conversate for a few, ‘cause in a few we gon' do
What we came to do, ain't that right, boo? 
Forget the telly, we just go to the crib
And watch a movie in the jacuzzi, smoke L's while you do me
I love it when you call me big poppa
Throw your hands in the air if you's a true player
I love it when you call me big poppa
To the honies getting money
Playing niggas like dummies
I love it when you call me big poppa
If you got a gun up in your waist
Please don't shoot up the place! 
‘Cause I see some ladies tonight
That should be having my baby, baby
 In mansions and Benzes
Givin' ends to my friends, and it feels stupendous
Tremendous cream: fuck a dollar and a dream
Still tote gats strapped with infrared beams
Choppin' Os, smokin' la in Optimos
Money, hoes and clothes: all a nigga knows
A foolish pleasure? Whatever
I had to find the buried treasure, so grams I had to measure
However, living better now, Coogi sweater now
Drop top BM's, I'm the man, girlfriend
Yeah, honey, check it—
Tell your friends to get with my friends
And we can be friends
Shit, we can do this every weekend, aight? 
Is that aight with you?

Watch this, lawd
Me holla respect, to all the gun men dem
Gun men alone, keep gun men friend
Fire bun, fi all the informer dem
Informer lone keep informer friend
Nineteen-seventy something, nigga I don't sweat the date
My moms is late so I had to plan my escape
Out the skins, in this world of fly girls
Tanqueray and Hennessy until I cold hurl
Ten months in this gut, what the fuck
I wish moms would hurry up so I could get buck
Wild juvenile ripping mics and shit
New York, New York, ready for the likes of this
Then came the worst date, May 21st
2:19, that's when my momma water burst
No spouse in the house so she rode for self
To the hospital, to see if she could get a little help
Umbilical cord's wrapped around my neck
I'm seeing my death and I ain't even took my first step
I made it out, I'm bringing mad joy
The doctor looked and said, 
He's going to be a bad boy
Me holla respect, to all the gun men dem
Gun men alone, keep gun men friend
Fire bun, fi all the informer dem
Informer lone keep informer friend
Now I'm thirteen, smoking blunts, making cream
On the drug scene, fuck a football team:
Risking ruptured spleens by the age of sixteen
Hearing the coach scream ain't my lifetime dream! 
I mean I want to blow up, stack my dough up
So school I didn't show up, it fucked my flow up
Mom said that I should grow up and check myself
Before I wreck myself, disrespect myself
Put the drugs on the shelf? Nah, couldn't see it
Scarface, King of New York, I want to be it
Rap was secondary, money was necessary
Until I got incarcerated--kinda scary
C74-Mark 8 set me straight
Not able to move behind the great steel gate
Time to contemplate, damn, where did I fail? 
All the money I stacked was all the money for bail
Me holla respect, to all the gun men dem
Gun men alone, keep gun men friend
Fire bun, fi all the informer dem
Informer lone keep informer friend
Me holla respect, to all the gun men dem
Gun men alone, keep gun men friend
Fire bun, fi all the informer dem
Informer lone keep informer friend
Ninety-four, now I explore new horizons
Mama smile when she see me, that's surprising
Honeys is tantalizing, they freak all night
Peep ducking cops on the creep all night
As I open my eyes and realizing I changed
Not the same deranged child stuck up in the game
And to my niggas living street life
Learn to treat life to the best, put stress to rest
Still tote your vest man, niggas be tripping
In the streets without a gat? Nah, nigga you're slipping
If I'm pimping on The F with weed on my breath
Original hustler with the muffler on the Tec
Respect to the macks in the Ac's
To the freaks in the Jeeps, lick shots to my peeps
Me holla respect, to all the gun men dem
Gun men alone, keep gun men friend
Fire bun, fi all the informer dem
Informer lone keep informer friend
Me holla respect, to all the gun men dem
Gun men alone, keep gun men friend
Fire bun, fi all the informer dem
Informer lone keep informer friend

But you know I don't do this, I don't even know how to do this
I'm just sayin', jus-just a little peck mami, for daddy
Just a little peck
Like that? 
That's what I'm sayin', yeah
You know I don't be doin' this though tho', you know that
Whatever bitch, damnit
Fuck the bitches, fuck all the stank-ass hoes, all my niggas know
Junior M.A.F.I.A. clique, Gucci Don, you know how we play
Fuckin scandalous-ass bitches; you know how it go, Gooch

Next thing you know you fuckin the bitch
You just pass it around and shit, pass the shit like a cold and shit

Now when I'm fucking off gin I'm invincible
Don't love no ho, that's my principle
Cause uh, bitches come  bitches go
That's why I get my nut and I be out the fucking door
 they might be the one to set me up
Want to get they little brother to wet me up
That's why I tote Tecs and stuff to get them off my case
Just in case the little fucker ends up misplaced
I don't give a bitch enough to catch the bus
And when I see the semen I'm leaving
Bitches be scheming, I kid you not
That's why I keep my windows locked and my Glock cocked
One ho said 
Thug nigga until the end, tell a friend bitch
Cause when I like you, then you go and fuck my friend bitch
You know that ain't right
With a friend of mine
You see, I don't sweat these hoes
I keep them in flavors like Timbos and Girbauds
Bitches just like to play the merry-go
It was me, Dee, the MPV
The blunts and brew thang, knocking some Wu-tang
M-E-T-H-Oh shit, look at them lips and them hips on that bitch
Dee hit the dip, so I can drop my mackadocious shit
Light the blunt clip, and recognize a pimp
Needless to speak, the G's obsolete
Don't sleep, banged the skins in a week
On the creep up the avenue
I seen her on the block, who she rapping to? 
That's my nigga Dee, damn he got G
Now she fucking him and fucking me, see
You know that ain't right
Uh now I play her far like a moon play a star
She still sweat me hard cause I'm a rap star
I be cruising up the block, I be passing her
Pimping hard with the female passenger
And the only time I call her to hang
Is when me and Dee blunted up, pissy, scheming on a gang-bang
She should have used her intuition
Then she wouldn't be classified in that position, listen
She's saying I dissed her cause I'm fucking her sister
A message to the fellas, that really gets them pissed, uh
But she started that fucking family
She fucked my man Dee, so why she mad at me? 
Plus your sister look better than you
Give head better than you, pussy get wetter than you
So break the fuck out like a rash
I'm glad I ain't spend no cash to hit your nasty ass
Biggie Smalls is the illest
What? 
Biggie Smalls is the illest
Live from Bedford-Stuyvesant
The livest one
Representing BK to the fullest
Gats, I pull it
Bastards ducking when Big be bucking
Chickenheads be clucking, in my bathroom fucking
It ain't nothing
They know BIG be handling
With the Mac in the Ac' door paneling
Bandaging MC's
Oxygen they can't breathe
Mad tricks up the sleeve
Wear boxers so my dick can breathe
Breeze through in the Q -
45 by my side
Lyrical high
And those that rushes my clutches get put on crutches
Get smoked like dutches from the master
Hate to blast you but I have to
You see I smoke a lot
Your life is played out like Kwame
And them fucking polka dots
Who rock the spot, Biggie
You know how the weed go, unbelievable
I's unbelievable
Biggie Smalls is the illest
B-I-G, G-I-E
A.K.A., B.I.G
Get it? Biggie
Also known as the bon appetit
Rappers can't sleep
Need sleeping
Big keep creeping
Bullets heat-seeking
Casualties need treating
Dumb rappers need teaching
Lesson A: Don't fuck with B-I
That's that 
Oh I, thought he was wack
Oh come come now
Why y'all so dumb now
Hunt me or be hunted
I got three hundred and fifty-seven ways
To simmer sauté
I'm the winner all day
Lights get dimmer down Biggie's hallway
My forte causes Caucasians to say
He sounds demented
Car weed scented
If I said it, I meant it
Bite my tongue for no one
Call me evil, or unbelievable
I's unbelievable
Biggie Smalls is the illest
Buck shots out the sun roof of Lexus coupes
Leave no witnesses
What you think this is? 
Ain't no amateurs here
I damage and tear
MC's fear me
They too near not to hear me
Clearly, I'm the triple beam dream
One thousand grams of uncut to the gut
It seems fucked up, the way I touched up the grill
Trying to play gorilla, when you ain't no killer
The gat's by your liver, your upper lip quiver
Get ready to die, tell God I said hi
And throw down some ice for the nicest MC
Niggas know the steelo, unbelievable
I's unbelievable
Biggie Smalls is the illest
Hello? Aw shit, nigga! 
What the fuck time is it, man? 
Oh goddamn, nigga! 
Do you know what time it is? 
Aw shit, what the fuck's goin' on? You a'ight? 
Nigga, what the fuck is wrong with you? 
When I die, fuck it, I wanna go to hell
'Cause I'm a piece of shit, it ain't hard to fuckin' tell
It don't make sense, goin' to heaven with the goodie-goodies
Dressed in white, I like black Timbs and black hoodies
God'll prob'ly have me on some real strict shit
No sleepin' all day, no gettin' my dick licked
Hangin' with the goodie-goodies, loungin' in paradise
Fuck that shit, I wanna tote guns and shoot dice
All my life I been considered as the worst
Lyin' to my mother, even stealin' out her purse
Crime after crime, from drugs to extortion
I know my mother wish she got a fuckin' abortion
She don't even love me like she did when I was younger
Suckin' on her chest just to stop my fuckin' hunger
I wonder: if I died, would tears come to her eyes? 
Forgive me for my disrespect, forgive me for my lies
My baby mother's eight months, her little sister's two
Who's to blame for both of them? 
I swear to God I want to just slit my wrists and end this bullshit
Throw the Magnum to my head, threaten to pull shit
And squeeze until the bed's completely red
I'm glad I'm dead, a worthless fuckin' buddha head
The stress is buildin' up, I can't— I can't believe
Suicide's on my fuckin' mind, I wanna leave
I swear to God I feel like death is fuckin' callin' me
But nah, you wouldn't understand
You see it's kinda like the crack did to Pookie in New Jack
Except when I cross over, there ain't no comin' back
Should I die on the train track like Ramo in Beat Street
People at the funeral frontin' like they miss me
My baby mama kiss me, but she glad I'm gone
She know me and her sister had somethin' goin' on
I reach my peak, I can't speak
Call my nigga Chic, tell him that my will is weak 
I'm sick of niggas lyin', I'm sick of bitches hawkin'
Matter of fact, I'm sick of talkin' BANG
Heartbeat slowing

Your heartbeat sound like Sasquatch feet
Thundering, shaking the concrete
Then the shit stop when I foil the plot
Neighbors call the cops, said they heard mad shots
Saw me in the drop, three and a quarter
Slaughter, electrical tape around your daughter
Old school, new school need to learn though
I burn, baby, burn like 
Disco Inferno
Burn slow like blunts with yayo
Peel more skins than Idaho Potato
Niggas know: the lyrical molesting is taking place
Fucking with B.I.G. it ain't safe
I make your skin chafe, rashes on them asses
Bumps and bruises, blunts and Land Cruisers
Big Poppa smash fools, bash fools
Niggas mad because I know that cash rules
Everything around me two Glock 9s

Stack mad chips, spread love with my peeps

Think the Cognac and indo sack make me slack? 
I switches all that, cocksucker G's up
One false move, get Swiss cheesed up
Clip to TEC, respect I demand it
Slip and break the 11th Commandment
Thou shalt not fuck with nor see Poppa
Feel a thousand deaths when I drop ya
I feel for you, like Chaka Khan I'm the don
Pussy when I want, Rolex on the arm
You'll die slow but calm
Recognize my face, so there won't be no mistake
So you know where to tell Jake, lame nigga
Brave nigga, turned front page nigga
Puff Daddy flips daily
I smoke the blunts he sips on the Baileys
On the rocks, tote Glocks at christenings
Hammer cock, in the fire position and...
Come here, come here, 
Open your fucking mouth, open your—didn't I tell you? 
Don't fuck with me? 
Huh? Didn't I tell you not to fuck with me?

As I sit back relax, steam a blunt, sip a Becks
Think about the sexy singers that I wanna sex
I'd probably go to jail for fucking Patti La
Belle
Ooh Regina Belle, she'd probably do me swell
Jasmine Guy was fly, Mariah Carey's kinda scary
Wait a minute, what about my honey Mary? 
Them jeans they fitting like a glove
I had a crush on you since Real Love
Hold your horses, I'mma show you who the boss of intercourse is
Sex, I'm taking no losses
Even groups like SWV and TLC
Can't see B.I.G. with telepathy
The recipe, a pinch of hardcore with a gun
Pimping ain't easy but it sure is fun
When I bust my nuts I bust'em one by one
So what's the 4-1-1 hun? 
Dreams of fucking an R&B bitch
I'm just playing... I'm saying
Dreams of fucking an R&B bitch
I'm just playing... I'm saying
I'll put Chante Moore pussy in stitches
I'll fuck Ru
Paul before I fuck them ugly ass Xscape bitches
You can 76 the 69, try 68
Make Raven-Symoné call date rape
Only cause Im paid, I'm fucking all of Jade
And my DJ Zhane she likes it when they say
Everybody move your body
Got Whitney Houston boosting from Bobby
As I bust the cherry of Monica and Terry
Backshots to Chaka, I know that pussy hairy
Sade, ooh, I know that pussy tight
Smack Tina Turner give her flashbacks of Ike
Smoke a stoge, fucking En Vogue because it's four of them
Jimmy hats for Patra, I'm using all of them
If that bitch give me action...guaranteed satisfaction
Dreams of fucking an R&B bitch
I'm just playing... I'm saying
Dreams of fucking an R&B bitch
I'm just playing... I'm saying
Previously on Ready to Die
... me and her sister had something going on
I reach my peak, I can't speak
Call my nigga Chic, tell him that my will is weak
I'm sick of niggas lying, I'm sick of bitches hawkin'
Matter of fact, I'm sick of talking
Damn... we was s'pose to rule the world baby
We was unstoppable! 
The shit can't be over, no
The shit can't be over, man
I know you hear me nigga
I know you hear me
You got too much livin' to do
Too much unfinished business
It ain't over
Live your life
Ah, ah! I'm sittin' in the crib dreamin' about Learjets and coupes
The way Salt shoops and how they sell records like Snoop - 
I'm interrupted by a doorbell, 3:52 - Who the hell is this? 
I gets up quick, cocks my shit
Stop the dogs from barkin', then proceed to walk in
I's a face that I seen before
My nigga Sing, we used to sling on the 16th floor
Check it! I look deeper; I see blood up on his sneakers
And his fist gripped a chrome four-fifth
So I dip, nigga! Is you creepin' or speakin'? 
He tells me C-Rock just got hit up at the Beacon
I opens up the door, pitiful: 
Is he in critical? 
Retaliation for this one won't be minimal
Cause I'm a criminal way before the rap shit
Bust the gat shit; Puff won't even know what happened
If it's done smoothly, silencers on the Uzi
Stash in the hooptie, my alibi: any cutie
With a booty that done fuck Big Pop
Head spinnin', reminiscin''bout my man C-Rock
Somebody gotta die
If I go, you got to go
Somebody gotta die
Let the gunshots blow
Somebody gotta die
Nobody got to know
That I killed yo ass in the midst, kid
Somebody gotta die
If I go, you got to go
Somebody gotta die
Let the gunshots blow
Somebody gotta die
Nobody got to know
That I killed yo ass in the midst, kid
Fillin' clips, he explained our situation
Precisely, so we know exactly what we facin'
Some kid named Jason, in a Honda station wagon
Was braggin', about how much loot and crack he stackin'
Rock had a grip so they formed up a clique
A small crew'round the time I was locked up with you
True indeed
But yo nigga, let me proceed
Don't fill them clips too high, give them bullets room to breathe
Damn, it was our year
Went outta town, blew the fuck up
D-Roc went home and Jay got stuck the fuck up
Hit him twice, caught him right for the Persian white
Pistol whipped his kids and taped up his wife 
He figured Roc set'em up, no question
Wet em up no less than 50 shots in his direction
How many shots?  
Man nigga, I seen mad holes
What kinda gats?  
Hecklers, Kochs, and Calicos
But fuck that, I know where all them niggas rest at
In the buildin' hustlin' and they don't be strapped
Supreme in black is downstairs, the engine runnin'
Find a bag to put the guns in, and c'mon if you're comin'
Somebody gotta die
If I go, you got to go
Somebody gotta die
Let the gunshots blow
Somebody gotta die
Nobody got to know
That I killed yo ass in the midst, kid
Somebody gotta die
If I go, you got to go
Somebody gotta die
Let the gunshots blow
Somebody gotta die
Nobody got to know
That I killed yo ass in the midst, kid
Exchanged hugs and pounds before the throw down
How it's gonna go down? 
Lay these niggas low-down
Slow down, ah, fuck all that plannin' shit
Run up in they cribs and make the cats abandon ship! 
See niggas like you do ten-year bids
Miss the niggas they want and murder innocent kids
Not I, one nigga's in my eye, that's Jason
Ain't no slugs gonna be wasted
Revenge I'm tastin' at the tip of my lips
I can't wait to fill my clip in his hips
Pass the chocolate, Thai! 
Sing ain't lie
There's Jason with his back to me
Talkin' to his faculty
I start to get a funny feeling
Put the mask on in case his niggas start squealin'
Scream his name out: 
Ay yo, playboy!  - squeezed six, nothin' shorter
Nigga turned around holdin' his daughter
Hah, sicker than your average
Poppa twist cabbage off instinct
Niggas don't think shit stink
Pink gators, my Detroit players
Timbs for my hooligans in Brooklyn
Dead right, if the head right, Biggie there e'ry night
Poppa been smooth since days of Underroos
Never lose, never choose to, bruise crews who
Do somethin' to us, talk go through us
Girls walk to us, wanna do us, screw us
Who us? Yeah, Poppa and Puff
Close like Starsky and Hutch, stick the clutch
Dare I squeeze three at your cherry M-3
Bang every MC easily, busily
Recently niggas frontin', ain't sayin' nothin'
So I just speak my piece, keep my peace
Cubans with the Jesus piece, with my peeps
Packin', askin', 
Who want it? 
You got it, nigga, flaunt it
That Brooklyn bullshit, we on it
Biggie, Biggie, Biggie, can't you see? 
Sometimes your words just hypnotize me
And I just love your flashy ways
Guess that's why they broke, and you're so paid
I put hoes in NY onto DKNY
Miami, D.C. prefer Versace
All Philly hoes go with Moschino
Every cutie with a booty bought a Coogi
Now who's the real dookie? 
Meaning, who's really the shit? 
Them niggas ride dicks, Frank White push the six
Or the Lexus, LX, four and a half
Bulletproof glass, tints if I want some ass
Gonna blast, squeeze first, ask questions last
That's how most of these so-called gangsters pass
At last, a nigga rappin' about blunts and broads
Tits and bras, ménage à trois, sex in expensive cars
I'll still leave you on the pavement
Condo paid for, no car payment
At my arraignment, note for the plaintiff
Your daughter's tied up in a Brooklyn basement
Face it, not guilty, that's how I stay filthy
Richer than Richie,'til you niggas come and get me
Biggie, Biggie, Biggie, can't you see? 
Sometimes your words just hypnotize me
And I just love your flashy ways
Guess that's why they broke, and you're so paid
I can fill you with real millionaire shit 
Escargot, my car go, one sixty, swiftly
Wreck it, buy a new one
Your crew run-run-run, your crew run-run
I know you sick of this, name brand nigga with
Flows, girls say he's sweet like licorice
So, get with this nigga, it's easy
Girlfriend, here's a pen, call me round ten
Come through, have sex on rugs that's Persian
Come up to your job, hit you while you workin'
For certain, Poppa freakin', not speakin'
Leave that ass leakin', like rapper demo
Tell them ho take they clothes off slowly
Hit'em with the force like Obi
Dick black like Toby
Watch me roam like Romey
Lucky they don't owe me
Where the safe? Show me, homie 
I gots to talk
I gotta tell what I feel
I gotta talk about my life as I see it
Biggie
This goes out to you
This goes out to you, and you, and you, and you
This goes out to you
This goes out to you
This goes out to you, and you, and you
Your reign on the top was short like leprechauns
As I crush so-called willies, thugs, and rapper-dons
Get in that ass, quick fast, like Ramadan
I's that rap phenomenon Don Dada, fuck Poppa
You got to call me Francis M.H. White
Intake light tokes, tote iron
Was told in shootouts, stay low and keep firin'
Keep extra clips for extra shit
Who's next to flip on that cat with that grip on rap
The most shady,  Frankie baby
Ain't no telling where I may be
May see me in D.C. at Howard Homecoming
With my man Capone, gumming, fucking something
You should know my steelo
Went from ten G's for blow to thirty G's a show
To orgies with hoes I never seen before
So, Jesus, get off the Notorious
Penis before I squeeze and bust
If the beef between us, we can settle it
With the chrome and metal shit
I make it hot like a kettle get
You're delicate, you better get - who sent ya? 
You still pedal shit, I got more rides than 
Great Adventure
Biggie 
Kick in the door, waving the four-four
All you heard was Poppa don't hit me no more
Kick in the door, waving the four-four
All you heard was Poppa don't hit me no more
Kick in the door, waving the four-four
All you heard was Poppa don't hit me no more
Kick in the door, waving the four-four
All you heard was Poppa don't hit me no more
On ya mark, get set, when I spark, ya wet
Look how dark it get when you're marked for death
Should I start your breath or should I let you die
In fear you start to cry, ask why
Lyrically I'm worshiped, don't front, the word sick
You cursed it, but rehearsed it
I drop unexpectedly like bird shit
You herbs get stuck quickly for royalties and show money
Don't forget the publishing, I punish em, I'm done with them
Son, I'm surprised you run with them
I think they got cum in them cause they nothing but dicks
Trying to blow up like nitro and dynamite sticks
Mad I smoke hydro, rock diamonds that's sick
Got paid off my flow, rhyme with my own clique
Take trips to Cairo, laying with your bitch
I know you praying you was rich, fucking prick
When I see ya I'mma
Kick in the door, waving the four-four
All you heard was Poppa don't hit me no more
Kick in the door, waving the four-four
All you heard was Poppa don't hit me no more
Kick in the door, waving the four-four
All you heard was Poppa don't hit me no more
Kick in the door, waving the four-four
All you heard was Poppa don't hit me no more
This goes out for those that choose to use
Disrespectful views on the King of N-Y
Fuck that, why try, throw bleach in your eye
Now ya brailling it, snatch that light shit, I'm scaling it
Conscious of ya nonsense, in eighty-eight
Sold more powder than Johnson and Johnson
Tote steel like Bronson, 
Vigilante
You wanna get on son, you need to ask me
Ain't no other kings in this rap thing
They siblings, nothing but my children
One shot they disappearin'
I's ill when MC's used to be on cruddy shit
Took home Ready to Die, listened, studied shit
Now they on some money shit, successful out the blue
They light weight, fragile, my nine milli
Make the whites shake, that's why my money never funny
And you still recouping, stupid stupid stupid stupid..
Uh, I like that, you like that? 
Here's another one, and another one
And another one, and another one
Uh

You must be used to me spending 
And all that sweet wining and dining
Well, I'm fuckin' you tonight
Uh, Here's another one
And another one
Uh, uh, what
Some say the X, make the sex Spec-tacular
Make me lick you from yo' neck to your back, then ya
Shivering, tongue delivering
Chills up that spine, that ass is mine
Skip the wine and the candlelight, no Cristal tonight
If it's all right with you, we fuckin' 
Deja vu, the blunts sparked, finger fuckin' in the park
Pissy off Bacardi Dark
Remember when I used to play between your legs? 
You begged for me to stop because you know where it would head
Straight to your mother's bed
Not the Marriott, we be lucky if we find a spot
Next to your sister, damn I really missed the
Way she used to rub my back, when I hit that
Way she used to giggle when your ass would wiggle
Now I know you're used to suites at the Parker Meridien
Trips to the Caribbean
But tonight, no ends
You must be  used to me spending
You must be used to me 
And all that sweet wining and dining 
Well, I'm fuckin' you tonight

And another one

And another one 
Uh, uh
Girl you look fine
Like a wide face Rolex, you just shine
I like that waistline
Let me hit that from behind, which wall you wanna climb
My style genuine, girl I love you long time
I got you pinned up, with your fuckin' limbs up
All because you like the way my Benz was rimmed up
Bitch keep yo' chin up, please watch me do thee
Nasty, like it when you make it move fast mami
I like it when you tro' it pon me
No love makin', strictly back breakin'
Cease know, all his hoes, go to my door
Then they go to his flo', to fuck some more
So no, caviar, Shark Bar, uh-uh
Strictly sex that's sweaty and leftover spaghetti
I know you used to slow CD's and Dom P's
But tonight it's eight tracks and six-packs while I hit that
You must be used to me spending
And all that sweet wining and dining 
Well, I'm fuckin' you tonight
Can you feel me? ,'cause I can feel you
Can you feel me? ,'cause I can feel you
You must be used to me spending

Well, I'm fuckin' you tonight 
Should I? , I may
Can I live til my last day
Hittin honies that be na-sty
Gettin money in the fast way
And I only care halfway
But I still can't let you pass me
Yo what's beef to you, three niggas with hoodies and bats
That ain't shit compared to one small cat with gats
When we came here we cut off all kind circulation
Breathin, eatin, the whole situation
When we do our shit we do our shit for real
While you take your money for your deal and make your own beats
Compose your own sheets, that's aight but chill
I'mma spend that mil and cop only hot shit
Rock top shit you know how The Lox get
Then you can see me flyin in the Bentley cockpit
Lox and B-I, hold our grica down for years
Gang not, but we been had our black tears
Niggas under the stairs only understand what we got
Underground, all above must get shot
You couldn't book me Dano, Sheek Luciano put the burners
To all y'all, what nigga bring it I'm callin y'all
You already know what it's about when I run up in your house
Put the gun up in your mouth and get the money out the couch
Hearin you out is senseless, perhaps for instance
I give this faggot a french kiss
Black gloves, no prints, dark tints
Word on the street they ain't heard from him since
You know about life after kickin the kid in
Since me and my mi-dan can flip seven gri-dams
Scri-dam, the flow is forbidd-en
Either you ridin or you dyin cause we swingin iron
Lox and Poppa, turning niggas into  Jim Hoffa
Who gon stop us, your last joint double copper
You gettin money or your runnin from the Feds
Ain't nothing over here but 16 with one in the head
And I solemnly swear
That all y'all niggas out there got a problem this year
 - 2X
 Before you think of keepin me down, heatin me down
The flow like water get deep and you drown
With no soul, many niggas roll with no dough
Even the small gun got a little black hole
Your destiny is somethin you can never figure out
Niggas is never happy til there's blood up in your mouth
There's a lot of killers, but who the hell are you to blame
There's a lot of dead, how the hell you take the pain? 
Live with it got money you better give with it
My man had the thug in him did his bid with it
Get married to the game but never have a kid with it
Advice from the wise, slice the pies
Too many schemes devised, when dreams collide
Teams provide, war for the street to absorb
Stashed in the ceiling and you slept on the floor
Only a blind dove'll fall in love with a whore
Uhh, uhh, uhh
Who the fuck wanna squeeze? 
My Desert E's make MC's freeze
You wakin up in cold sweats, they just dreams
You still apologizin, analyzin, my size and your size and
Realizin, a fist fight would be asinine
You just pop wines I must pop nines
Genuine steel piece, nozzle in your grill piece
You're shook up, two bricks, every cook up
We can hook up, all I see is the future
Disrespect, I shoot ya
By the way, them bricks, get flipped weekly
Sold by soldiers that mix weed with the leak leak
Die for a dollar nigga, life ain't sweet
Play for keeps wet shirts with experts on the creep
Our beef is my fiance, about to marry it
Illegal transactions in Farragut with Arabics
Why not, they fit twelve up in the bedroom
Imagine what they stash is like, make you a classic like
My first LP, beef with me is unhealthy
Fuck around and get an ul-cer, loose your pulse or
Collapsed lung, look how many gats I brung
For them homos, still doin promos
Break both your legs you're movin slow-mo, got shine to glow mo'
Nine hundred and ninety six grams, you need four mo'
 - repeat to fade
We push the hottest V's, peel fast
Through the city, play Monopoly with real cash
Me and Biggie and the models be shaking they sadiddy ass
And Prada be something you cats got to see
And the watches be all types and shapes of stones
Being broke is childish and I'm quite grown
Run up in the club with the ice on, me and Paisan
Scope the spot out, see something nice and I'm gone
You cats is home screaming the fight's on
I'm in the fifteen hundred seats, watching Tyson
Same night, same fight
But one of us cats ain't playing right, I let you tell it
People place yourselves in the shoes of two felons
And tell me you won't ball every chance you get
And any chance you hit, we live for the moment
Makes sense don't it? Now make dollars
Cats pop bottles, bone chicks that favor Idalis
And rack up frequent flight mileage
I love the dough, more than you know
Gotta let it show, I love the dough, hey
I love the dough, more than you know
Gotta let it show, I love the dough, hey
I'm popping Magnums while Jigga bag something
Watch is platinum, got jet lag from
Flights back and forth, pop corks of the best grapes
Make the best CDs and the best tapes
Don't forget the vinyl, take girls break spinals
Biggie be Richie like Lionel, shit
You seen the Jesús, dipped to H classes
Ice project off lights, chick flashes
Blind your broke asses, even got rocks in the beards and moustaches
Rock top fashions
Ain't shit changed, except the number after the dot
On the Range, way niggas look at me now, kinda strange
I hate y'all too
Rather be in Carribean sands with Rachel
I's unreal, out the blue Frank White got sex appeal
Bitches used to go, 
Ewww! 
Still tote steel, I'm trying to see five mil off the single, for real
You ain't fazing the amazing
While your gun's raising, mine is blazing
See you on see me all talking to sweetness
Take it for weakness and leave quick
Blocka, Roc-a-Fella, Bad Boy collabo
Two MCs with mad dough, you know
I love the dough, more than you know
Gotta let it show, I love the dough, hey
I love the dough, more than you know
Gotta let it show, I love the dough, hey
Miraculous, pockets stay full
Niggas skip the bull cause we matadors
Snatch the P89s that we pack in the drawers
And we clap the doors of your Acuras
Snap like cameras on amateurs
Make you all dance, hold a hammer to yours
Jig and Big rock ice, no cracks or flaws
Everybody got a part to play, back to yours
Run up in your crib now, crack your doors
Watch the real players live, it's a habit to floss
Play the charts like The Beatles, y'all adapt you lost
And toast Cristal on behalf of y'all
Too bad for y'all
Ain't too many as bad as yours truly
Do we, we laugh at y'all
Little bastards y'all
We hit makers with acres
Roll shakers in Vegas, you can't break us
Lost chips on Lakers, gassed off Shaq
Country house, tennis courts on horseback
Riding, deciding cracked crab or lobster
Who say mobsters don't prosper
Niggas is actors, niggas deserve Oscars
Me I'm critically acclaimed, slug passed your brain
Reminisce on dames whose coochie used to stink
When we rocked house pieces and puffy Gucci links
Now we buy homes in unfamiliar places
Tito smile every time he see our faces
Cases catch more than outfielders
Half these rapping cats ain't seen war
Couldn't score if they had point game, they lame
Speak my name, I make'em dash like Dame
I love the dough, more than you know
Gotta let it show, I love the dough, hey
I love the dough, more than you know
Gotta let it show, I love the dough, hey

Motherfuckers still in my biz

Fuck'em in the ass, throw'em over the bridge
That's how it is, my shit is laid out
Fuck that beef shit, that shit is played out
Y'all got the gall, all I make is one phone call
All y'all disappear by tomorrow
All your guns is borrowed, I don't feel sorrow
Actually, your man passed the Gat to me, now check this
What's beef? Beef is when you need 2 Gats to go to sleep
Beef is when your moms ain't safe up in the streets
Beef is when I see you
Guaranteed to be in ICU, one more time
What's beef? Beef is when you make your enemies start your Jeep
Beef is when you roll no less than 30 deep
Beef is when I see you
Guaranteed to be in ICU
I done smoked with the best of em
Shot at the rest of em
Was about a hundred or more...maybe less of em
Got my rocks off, that nigga from the Brook just be
Wilin' on you, just be stylin' on you
When I, tried to warn you but your eyes fucked up
Now I cleared them shits with hits you on the fucking bench
Pardon my French but, uh, sometimes I get kind of
Peeved at these weak MC's with the
Supreme ballerlike lyrics. I call em like I see em, G
Y'all niggas sound like me
Y'all was grimy in the early 90s, far behind me
It ain't hard to find me, number one with the booyaka
Give me the Remy and the chronic, ain't no telling what I do to ya
I's obvious the game's new to ya
Take them ends you make
And spend em on a tutor hah, one shot, I'm through with ya
What's beef? Beef is when you need 2 Gats to go to sleep
Beef is when your moms ain't safe up in the streets
Beef is when I see you

What's beef? Beef is when you make your enemies start your Jeep
Beef is when you roll no less than 30 deep
Beef is when I see you
Guaranteed to be in ICU
There'll be nothin' but smooth sailing
When I spit shots, now your crew's bailing
All I got is heat and tough talk for you
Tie you up, cut your balls off just to use
Man, listen, straight torture
Look what that slick shit bought ya
A first class ticket to Lucifer, real name Christopher
Watch me set it off like Vivica
Here lies your demise, close your eyes
Think good thoughts, die while your skin start to glisten
Pale blue hands get cold: your soul's risen
I's bad cause I just begun
What make the shit real bad
I was havin' fun
Yo
C-Gutta, where you at? 
D Rockafella
Caesar Leo Degenero
Blake C
Money SL
Uhh
B.I.G. is making this cream
Bitches always say what the hell does that mean? 
B is for the bitches, who can't understand
How one fly nigga became a man
I is for the way it goes in and out
One by one I knocks'em out
G is for the way the game goes in the gutter
Other MC's man they ain't sayin' nuthin'
Rockin' on, to the break of dawn
Meet the bitch, get the pussy, get the math, I'm gone
What? 
It ain't no more to it
Now, who's hot, who not? 
Tell me who rock, who sell out in the stores? 
You tell me who flopped, who copped the blue drop? 
Whose jewels got rocks? 
Who's mostly Dolce down to the tube sock? 
The same old pimp, Mase
You know ain't nothing change but my limp
Can't stop till I see my name on a blimp
Guarantee a million sales, call it level up
You don't believe in Harlem World, nigga, double up
We don't play around, it's a bet, lay it down
Niggas didn't know me'91, bet they know me now
I'm the young Harlem nigga with the Goldie sound
Can't no Ph.D. niggas hold me down
Cudda schooled me to the game, now I know my duty
Stay humble, stay low, blow like Hootie
True pimp niggas spend no dough on the booty
And then you yell, 
There go Mase! , there go your cutie
I don't know what they want from me
I's like the more money we come across
The more problems we see
I'm the D to the A to the D-D-Y
Know you'd rather see me die than to see me fly
I call all the shots, rip all the spots
Rock all the rocks, cop all the drops
I know you thinking now, 
When all the ballin' stops? 
Nigga never home, gotta call me on the yacht
Ten years from now we'll still be on top
Yo, I thought I told you that we won't stop
Now what you gon' do with a crew
That got money much longer than yours
And a team much stronger than yours? 
Violate me, this'll be your day, we don't play
Mess around, be D.O.A. be on your way
‘Cause it ain't enough time here
Ain't enough lime here for you to shine here
Deal with many women but treat dimes fair
And I'm bigger than the city lights down in Times Square
I don't know what they want from me
I's like the more money we come across
The more problems we see
B-I-G P-O-P-P-A, no info for the DEA
Federal agents mad ‘cause I'm flagrant
Tap my cell and the phone in the basement
My team supreme, stay clean
Triple beam lyrical dream, I be that
Cat you see at all events bent
Gats in holsters, girls on shoulders
Playboy, I told ya, mere mics to me
Bruise too much, I lose too much
Step on stage, the girls boo too much
I guess it's ‘cause you run with lame dudes too much
Me lose my touch? Never that! 
If I did, ain't no problem to get the gat
Where the true players at? Throw your Rolies in the sky
Wave'em side to side and keep your hands high
While I give your girl the eye, player please
Lyrically, niggas see B.I.G be flossin’
Jig on the cover of Fortune, 5 double O
Here's my phone number, your man ain't got to know
I got the dough, got the flow down pizat
Platinum plus like thizat
Dangerous on trizacks, leave your ass flizat
I don't know what they want from me
I's like the more money we come across
The more problems we see
Today's agenda, got the suitcase up in the Sentra
Go to room 112, tell them Blanco sent ya
Feel the strangest, if no money exchanges
I got these kids in Ranges, to leave them niggas brainless
All they tote is stainless, you just remain as
Calm as possible, make the deal go through
If not, here's 12 shots, we know how you do
Please make your killings clean, slugs up in between
They eyes, like True Lies, kill them and flee the scene
Just bring back the coke or the cream
Or else, your life is on the shelf, we mean this, Frank
Them cats we fucking with put bombs in your mom's gas tank
Let's get this money baby, they shady, we get shady
Dress up like ladies and burn them with dirty.380s
Then they come to kill our babies, that's all out
I got gats that blow the wall out, clear them all out
Fuck the fallout, word to Stretch I bet they pussy
The seven digits push me, fucking real, here's the deal
I got a hundred bricks, 14, 5 a piece
Enough to cop a 6, buy the house on the beach
Supply the peeps with Jeeps, brick apiece, capiche? 
Everybody getting cream no one considered a leech
Think about it now, that's damn near 1.5
I kill them all I'll be set for life
Frank, pay attention
These motherfuckers is henchmen, renegades
If you die they still get paid, extra probably
Fuck a robbery, I'm the boss
Promise you won't rob'em, 
I promise
But of course you know I had my fingers crossed
Picture me being scared
Of a nigga that breathe the same air as me
Picture me being shook
We can both pull burners, make the motherfucking beef cook
Picture a nigga hiding
My life in that man's hands, while he just deciding
I'd rather go toe-to-toe with all of y'all
Running ain't in my protocol
Since it's on, I call my nigga Arizona Ron
From Tuscon, push the black Yukon
Usually had the slow grooves on, mostly rock the Isley
Stupid as a youngin, chose not the moves wisely
Sharper with game, him and his crooks caught a Jooks
Heard it was sweet, about 350 apiece
Ron bought a truck, two bricks laid in the cut
His peeps got bucked, got locked the fuck up
That's when Ron vanished, came back, speaking Spanish
Lavish habits, two rings, twenty carats
He's a criminal, nigga made America's Most
Killed his baby mother brother, slit his throat
The nigga got bagged with the toast
Weeded, took it to trial, beat it
Now he feel he undefeated, he mean it
Nothing to lose, tattooed around his gun wounds
Everything to gain, embedded in his brain
And me I feel the same for this money you dying
'Specially if my daughter crying, I ain't lying
Y'all know the science
We agreed to go in shooting is silly
Because niggas could be hiding in showers with mac-millis
So I freaked them, the telly manager was Puerto Rican
Gloria, from Astoria, I went to war with her
Peeps in ninety-one, stole a gun from my workers
And they took drugs, they tried to jerk us
We blazed they place -- long story. Glo' seen't my face
Got shook, thought a nigga was coming for the safe
Now she breaking
Shut up, 112, what's shaking? 
A Jamaican, some bitches I swear, they look gay
And a black Range Rover, been outside all day
If it's trouble let me know, I'll be on my way
Please, I got kids to feed, I done seen you make niggas bleed
Nightmare, this bitch don't need
Ron, get the gasoline, this spot, we about to blow this
Get the cash before the cops and Range Rover cats notice
Room 112, right by the staircase, perfect place
When they evacuate, they meet they fate
Ron pass the gasoline,  -- the nigga passed me kerosene
Fuck it, it's flame-able, my hunger is unexplainable
Strike the match, just what I expected
The dread kid ejected in seconds
And here come two, opposite sexes, one black, one Malaysian
We in the hallway waiting patient
As soon as she hit the door we start blasting
I saw her brains hit the floor, Ron laughing, I swear to God
I hit Maxi Priest at least twelve times in the chest
Spinned around, shot the chink in the breast
She crying, head shots put her to rest
Pop open the briefcases, nothing but Franklin faces
The spot's hot, sprinklers, alarm systems
That's when other guests start to slip in
I's time for us to get to dipping
I know them niggas in the Range is on they way up
Flipping, pistol gripping, I load the clip in
The hallway, got real loud and crowded
They walked right past us, I don't know how they allowed it
The funny thing about it, through all the excitement
They Range got towed, they double parked by a hydrant
Stupid motherfuckers
Who y'all talkin to man? 
Uhh
Check it out, check it out
This here goes out
To all the niggas that be fuckin mad bitches
In other niggas cribs
Thinkin shit is sweet
Nigga creep up on your ass, hahaha
Live niggas respect it, check it
I kick flows for ya, kick down doors for ya
Even left all my motherfuckin hoes for ya
Niggas think Frankie pussy whipped, nigga picture that
With a Kodak, Insta-ma-tak
We don't get down like that, lay my game down quite flat
Sweetness, where you parked at? 
Petiteness but that ass fat
She got a body make a nigga wanna eat that, I'm fuckin with you
The bitch official doe, dick harder than a missile yo
Try to hit, if she trippin disappearin like Arsenio
Yo, the bitch push a double-oh
With the five in front, probably a connivin stunt
Y'all drive in front, I'm a peel with her
Find the deal with her, she fuck around and steal, huh? 
Then we all get laced
Television's, Versace heaven, when I'm up in em
The shit she kicked, all the shit's legit
She get dick from a player off the New York Knicks
Nigga tricked ridiculous, the shit was plush
She's stressin me to fuck, like she was in a rush
We fucked in his bed, quite dangerous
I'm in his ass while he playin''gainst the Utah Jazz
My 112, CD blast, I was past
She came twice I came last, roll the grass
She giggle, sayin' 
I'm smokin' on home-grown
Then I heard the moan, honey I'm home! 
Yep, tote chrome for situations like this
I'm up in his broad I know he won't like this
Now I'm like, 
Bitch, you better talk to him
Before this fifth put a spark to him
Fuck around shit get dark to him, put a part through him
Lose a major part to him, arm, leg.
She beggin me to stop but this cat gettin closer
Gettin hot like a toaster, I cocks the toast, uhh
Before my eyes could blink
She screams out, 
Honey bring me up somethin to drink! 
He go back downstairs more time to think
Her brain racin, she's tellin me to stay patient
She don't know I'm, cool as a fan
Gat in hand, I don't wanna blast her man
But I can and I will though, I probably chill though
Even though situation lookin' kinda ill yo
It came to me like a song I wrote
Told the bitch, 
Gimme your scarf, pillowcase and rope.
Got dressed quick, tied the scarf around my face
Roped the bitch up, gagged her mouth with the pillowcase
Play the cut, nigga comin off some love potion shit
Flash the heat on'em, he stood emotionless
Dropped the glass screamin, 
Don't blast here's the stash
A hundred cash just don't shoot my ass, please! 
Nigga pullin mad G's out the floor
Put stacks in a Prada knapsack, hit the door
Grab the keys to the five, call my niggas on the cell
Bring some weed I got a story to tell, uhh
I's Bone and Biggie, Biggie…
Let's ride, let's ride, let's ride, let's ride, get high…
I's Bone and Biggie, Biggie…
Notorious thugs, gangstas…
I's Bone and Biggie, Biggie…
Let's ride, let's ride, let's ride, let's ride, get high…
Armed and dangerous
Ain't too many can bang with us
Straight up weed; no angel dust
Label us 
Notorious thug-ass niggas
That love to bust,  it's strange to us
Y'all niggas be scramblin', gamblin'
Up in restaurants with mandolins and violins
We just sittin' here tryna win, try not to sin
High off weed and lots of gin
So much smoke, need oxygen
Steadily countin' them Benjamins
Nigga, you should too
If you knew what this game'll do to you
Been in this shit since'92
Look at all the bullshit I been through! 
So-called beef with you-know-who
Fucked a few female stars or two
Then I blew like, nigga, move like Mike
Shit, not to be fucked with
Motherfucker better duck quick
‘Cause me and my dogs love to buck shit
Fuck the luck shit, strictly aim
No aspirations to quit the game
Spit your game, talk your shit
Grab your gat, call your clique
Squeeze your clip, hit the right one
Pass that weed, I got to light one
All them niggas, I got to fight one
All them hoes, I got to like one
Our situation is a tight one
What you gonna do: fight or run? 
Seems to me that you'll take B
Bone and Big, nigga, die slowly
I'ma tell you like a nigga told me
Cash Rules Everything Around Me
Shit, lyrically, niggas can't see me
Fuck it, buy the coke, cook the coke, cut it
Know the bitch'fore you caught yourself lovin' it
Nigga with a Benz fuckin' it
Doesn't it seem odd to you? 
Big come through with mobs and crews
Goodfellas down to the Mo' Thugs dudes
Who's the killer: me or you? 
7 AM, woke in the morning
With Hen' and caffeine and green and nicotine
No dough, so pop a couple of doze
Lil' RIPsta, nigga Mista Clean, nigga Dean
Deep in my temple and not to get sentimentally steamed
With my instrumelody, and heated, especially for your team
And a.45 indeed will beam in between the scenes
Destroy your dreams; you willin' to die? We'll see
How many flee when I cause the scene? 
We mean mug, Mo' Thugs, trained to be perfect disciples
When it's survival, tongue is a double-edged sword
Triple six rivals spittin' fire
This the real truth, bitch, breakin' out for lies
My Messiah's better be ready for Armageddon, shit's expired
I's wild, bless the child, the one that became a man
Put in positions off in the Clair
All that I had to do was stare
Test me now, contender; never no surrender, no pretend
Pick up my pen, in my hand, one of my trusted friend-friends
Hey, open it! Let's see if we're real, we all suited
Beg my pardon to Martin: baby, we ain't marchin', we shootin'
In daily recruitin', there's a thug born everyday in the ghetto
We start'em off little, we give'em a bible
And a pen and a pad to hit the label – kick it, nigga! 
Nigga roll with Bone up into the Thug spot
To the dome with a shot of bird
Never get tossed to the curb
Be feelin' that urge to splurge
But I'm broke as fuck, Sin, give me that Mossberg swerve! 
Up into my bag, ‘cause I gotta get my mask and shells
To put in this 12 gauge sawed-off
Get'em hauled off, nigga, your loss
Take it all off, got a nigga caught off
But the Bone, not Leatherface
Too many are thinkin' they thugs
And little Mo Hart want to pull it and bust it
And bitch, if you steppin', we buckin' them guts – that's fucked up
Now let me get done with the grime
Gotta go purchase a dime
Put in a state to get done with the crime
Smokin' the reefer to ease my mind
Swig some wine, step on the block with the rocks
But really we be servin' them dummies, see? 
Gotta buck him on down
If he come back talkin', like, 
Give me back me money! 
Thuggin' with me killers
Need us a liter of liquor, but niggas ain't got shit
With a sawed-off pump, chrome.38 pistol
Now, who ready to get bent? 
Nigga like me fiendin' for them green leaves
But I ain't had no dough
Gotta make some money
So I'm makin' my dummy rocks if I go broke
I's Bone and Biggie, Biggie
I's Bone and Biggie, Biggie
Let's ride, let's ride, let's ride, let's ride
Get high, get high, get high, c'mon
Let's ride, let's ride, let's ride, let's ride
Get high, get high, get high
Yeah, Little Lay, hey, comin' in the form of scripture
Finna get ya and hit ya with magic
Droppin' down lead, but I call it my gadgets
With an automatic-status, we spray
Time to load the Glocks, but I'm thinkin' not
There's another evil force tellin' me to do what I gotta do
So I up my pipe, a nigga dyin' tonight
And I'm always runnin' from the boys in blue
Biggie, blue’s on my ass
Pull out the cellular phone to call Bone: 
What's happenin'? 
Grab artillery, a nigga start packin'
‘Cause a motherfucker tried to get me in a jackin'
And I did him, hit him right between the eyes
The spot was wise; wanna test a nigga size, it'll cost him
Nigga fuck around with the wrong shit
Y'all get mo' murdered all day, all day
We done paved the way and I'm on the run
I'ma call my boys and bring all the guns
Y'all niggas wanna have a little fun with number one? 
Bloody red, red, rum, rum, rum, rum, rum, rum
That red, red, rum, rum, rum, rum, rum, rum
That red, red, rum…
I's Bone and Biggie, Biggie
I's Bone and Biggie, Biggie
Let's ride, let's ride, let's ride, let's ride
Get high, get high, get high, c'mon
Let's ride, let's ride, let's ride, let's ride
Get high, get high, get high
Fam, you know what I'm sayin? 
The motherfuckin shit just get me so motherfuckin' mad
‘Cause, you know, that was my nigga, you know
And like, I had just got the nigga Puff card and shit 
I knew the shit was'bout to go down
And my man was like hyping me
'Bout everywhere we go, me and O 
Me and O be together, and the nigga be like
Watch, I'm telling you when my man get on, it's gonna be some shit, we ain't gonna have to sell this shit no mo'
I'm telling you 
And the nigga just got moked out like that, man 
That shit fucked me up , man
Yo, man, I loved that nigga O too 
That was my motherfuckin' heart
Yeah, dedicating this to my nigga O
We miss you, nigga
Going out to all the young niggas that died in the struggle
Word up, shit is real in the field
You know, sparkin' blunts to all you niggas; word up
Each and every day
The daydreams of how we used to be
See your family
And that baby's lookin' just like you
Why'd you go away? 
I've been missin' you lately
Tell me what you're going through, oh yeah
I remember sellin' three bricks of straight flour
Got my man a beat down to the third power
He didn't care, spent the money in a half hour
Got some fishscale, reigned on competition like a shower
Got the coke cooked up, a crackhead Kevin
In'88, when Kane ruled with 
Half Steppin'
A.38, a lot of mouth was our only weapon
We was kings till the D's crept in; and now I'm missing'em
Ooh, I'm missin' you
Tell me why the road turns, why it turns
Ooh, I'm missin' you
Nah nah nah nah nah
Oh tell me why why why why
We work all week, weekends we play the movies
We rocked flatops, our girls rocked doobies
Made a killin', even though the D's knew me
Eventually, you know they try to do me
Fuck it! Fed up, my nigga wanted to take it down South
Sick of cops coming, sick of throwing jacks in his mouth
Gave him half my paper, told'em 
Go that route! 
Few months, he got his brain blown out, now I'm stressed
His baby's mother, she trippin', blamin' me
And his older brothers understand the game it be
Kinda topsy turvy; you win some, you lose some
Damn, they lost a brother, they mother lost a son
Fuck, why my nigga couldn't stay in N.Y.? 
I'm a thug, but I swear for three days I cried
I'd look in the sky and ask God why
Can't look his baby girls in the eye; damn, I'm missin' him
There was this girl around the way that made cats drool
Her name's Drew, played fools out they money in pool
People swore we was fuckin', but we was just cool
She used to hang while I slang my joints after school
She'd watch my bomb, help my moms with the groceries
My little sister, the girl was kinda close to me
A little closer than the average girl's supposed to be
Far from a lover, my girl was jealous of her
Then she started messin' with some major players
Handled keys, niggas called them the Bricklayers
A dread kid, had a baby'fore that bitch Taya
Found out her baby's father cheating
Now Drew, she gotta slay her
One night, across from the corner store
Taya ran around the block with a chrome four-four
Squeezed all six shots in the passenger door
The dude lived – what my baby had to die for? Missin' her
 Yeah, fuck you
 Fuck you too
 Fuck you bitch
 Fuck you motherfucker
 You ain't shit anyway, fuck you
 You ain't shit, you fat motherfucker
 Yeah, whatever whatever, you wasn't sayin' that when you was suckin' my dick
 You wasn't sayin that when you was eatin my pussy, you a nasty motherfucker
 Check it, uhh
 What do ya do when yo' bitch is untrue
Do you cut that hooker off and find someone new
I need another bitch , in my life
I know he don't treat you like I treat you
Time to explain your game is see-through
Sex is lethal, I ain't gon' lie
Means to get ya back, I ain't gon' try
Like this y'all, my girl sucked anotha nigga dick y'all
Light skinned with the chromed out six y'all
Thought they was creepin, took trips to V-A every third weekend
While you was sleepin', he hit you on the box
Sixty-nine code non-stop
Shoulda left ya then, but my heart said not
You knew too much, the relationship grew too much
You knew about the crack vials, means to be trialed
Where I hid dough under the bathroom tile
Waited for a while, thought you would be the right thing
Then things got frightening
Peep the scene, sorta like Sam Rothstein
Guess you Ginger, huh, go figure
Never thought you could be a gold-digger
Take my dough and spend with the next nigga
Asked my man Jigga, my ace boon coon
Told me cut the bitch off'fore the shit balloon
Now I'm like Brandy, Sittin' in My Room
Pissy drunk listenin' to Stylistics tunes
Or the O'Jays, thinkin' bout the old days
My nigga's like, fuck that bitch, go play
Baller, when she beep you, don't call her
Guess who I seen, that freak bitch Paula
She was askin' bout ya whereabouts
Here's the digits, I know you can wear that out
Tear that out the frame, ya game so tight
We'll be all fucking tonight 
Feel me? 
What do ya do when your man is untrue
Do you cut the sucker off and find someone new
I need another man, in my life
Member when you said you would die for me, shit
All of that was just lies to me
Motherfucker shoulda never said bye to me
Now you cry for me, like Jodeci
I's like that y'all, my nigga hit another bitch from the back y'all
Black nasty and mad fat y'all; shoulda seen the ho
Nigga pack your shit, you out the do', ohh
What about the fight in The Mirage
I seen ya Benz parked outside my sister's garage
Said it was your friend Rog, bullshit
I ain't gonna keep puttin' up wit the bullshit
And still I, never sweat these bitches
Q.B. hanged like plaques on the wall with your pictures
Scale them fishes, my love is concrete
Stashin' your heat in the passenger seat
Of the Nautica Jeep, we've been down for so long
Still a bitch like me tryin' to hold on
Teary eyed, damn a bitch steamin'
Girls steady screamin', Kim you need to leave him
When I testified in court
Couldn't think straight thinkin' bout the bitches I fought over you
Nigga have the shit you bought
And fuck you, movin' is my last resort
You see, nine outta ten niggas ain't shit
One outta five niggas suck a dick
You're mad at me, too bad she ain't as bad as me
Shoulda kept the freak bitch off my canapé
Now you see, ain't no pussy warm as mine
Long as mine, ain't no love as strong as this
When I sucked your dick, it's like smokin' a roach
Uhh, why go from first class to coach
Yo! 
Yo Big, wake up, wake up baby
Mmm, yo...

Head so hard, that your hat can't fit you
Either I'm with ya or against ya
Format venture, back through that maze I sent ya
Talking to the rap inventor
Nigga with the game tight, fifth of that flame right
Spell my name right, B-I, double-G, I-E
Iced out, lights out, me and Cease-a-Leo
Getting head from some chick he know
See it's all about the cheddar, nobody do it better
Going back to Cali, strictly for the weather
Women and the weed - sticky green
No seeds bitch please, Poppa ain't soft
Dead up in the hood, ain't no love lost
Got me mixed up, you drunk them licks up
Mad cause I got my dick sucked
And my balls licked, forfeit, the game is mine
I'ma spell my name one more time, check it
I's the, N-O, T-O, R-I, O
U-S, you just, lay down, slow
Recognize a real Don when you see one
Sipping on booze in the House of Blues
I'm going going, back back, to Cali Cali 
I'm going going, back back, to Cali Cali 
I'm going going, back back, to Cali Cali 
I'm going going, back back, to Cali Cali 
If I got to choose a coast I got to choose the East
I live out there, so don't go there
But that don't mean a nigga can't rest in the West
See some nice breast in the West
Smoke some nice sess in the West, y'all niggas is a mess
Thinking I'm gon stop, giving LA props
All I got is beef with those that violate me
I shall annihilate thee
Case closed, suitcase filled with clothes
Linens and things, I begin things
Beeper start to flash, 818's, 213's
313's, B.I.G
Frequently floss hoes at Roscoe's
If I wanna squirt her, take her to Fatburger
Spend about a week on Venice Beach
Sippin Crist-o, with some freaks from Frisco
I'm going going, back back, to Cali Cali 
I'm going going, back back, to Cali Cali 
I'm going going, back back, to Cali Cali 
I'm going going, back back, to Cali Cali 
Cali got gunplay, models on the runway
Scream Biggie Biggie gimme One More Chance
I be whipping on the freeway, the NYC way
On the celly-celly with my homeboy Lance
Pass hash from left to right
Only got five blunts left to light
I'm set tonight
Met a bitch at the Versace store
Said she suck it'til I ain't got no more, only in L.A
Bust on bitches be-lly, rub it in they tummy
Lick it, say it's yummy, then fuck your man
What's your plan, is it to rock the Tri-State
Almost gold, five Gs a show date
Or do you wanna see about seven digits
Fuck hoes exquisite
Cali, great place to visit1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
I's the ten crack commandments, what? 
Nigga can't tell me nothing about this coke
Can't tell me nothing about this crack, this weed, my hustlin' niggas
Niggas on the corner I ain't forget you niggas, my triple beam niggas
I've been in this game for years, it made me a animal
There's rules to this shit, I wrote me a manual
A step-by-step booklet for you to get
Your game on track, not your wig pushed back
Rule Nombre Uno: never let no one know
How much dough you hold cause you know
The cheddar breed jealousy'specially
If that man fucked up, get yo' ass stuck up
Number 2: never let'em know your next move
Don't you know Bad Boys move in silence and violence? 
Take it from your highness
I done squeezed mad clips at these cats for they bricks and chips
Number 3: never trust nobody
Your moms'll set that ass up, properly gassed up
Hoodied and masked up, shit, for that fast buck
She be laying in the bushes to light that ass up
Number 4: I know you heard this before
Never get high on your own supply
Number 5: never sell no crack where you rest at
I don't care if they want a ounce, tell'em bounce! 
Number 6: that goddamn credit? Dead it
You think a crackhead paying you back, shit forget it! 
7: this rule is so underrated
Keep your family and business completely separated
Money and blood don't mix like two dicks and no bitch
Find yourself in serious shit
Number 8: never keep no weight on you! 
Them cats that squeeze your guns can hold jums too
Number 9 shoulda been Number 1 to me:
If you ain't gettin' bagged stay the fuck from police
If niggas think you snitchin' they ain't trying to listen
They be sittin' in your kitchen, waiting to start hittin'
Number 10: a strong word called consignment
Strictly for live men, not for freshmen
If you ain't got the clientele, say hell no! 
Cause they gon' want they money rain sleet hail snow
Follow these rules you'll have mad bread to break up
If not, 24 years on the wake up
Slug hit your temple, watch your frame shake up
Caretaker did your makeup, when you passed
Your girl fucked my man Jake up
Heard in three weeks she sniffed a whole half of cake up
Heard she suck a good dick, and can hook a steak up
Gotta go gotta go, more pies to bake up, word up
Crack King, Frank Wiz-zhite
Good evening, and for my last hit
I'd like to take you back to the classic
A-hem, B.I.G. style of course, uhh

Lay on the ground, you've been robbed

This goes out to my Brooklyn crew
Representin on the freaky freaky
Fuck em all day fuck em all night
We don't love these hoes
I go on and on and on and
Don't take them to the crib unless they bonin'
Easy, call em on the phone and
Platinum Chanel cologne and
I stay dressed to impress
Spark these bitches interest
Sex is all I expect
If they watch TV in the Lex, they know
They know, quarter past 4
Left the club tipsy, say no mo'
Except how I'm gettin home tomorrow
Caesar drop you off when he see his P.O
Back of my mind I hope she swallow
Man she spilled a drink on my cream Wallows
Reach the gate, hungry just ate
Riffin, she got to be to work by eight
This must mean she ain't tryna wait
Conversate, sex on the first date
I state, 
You know what you do to me
She starts off, 
Well I don't usually
Then I whipped it out, rubber no doubt
Step out, show me what you all about
Fingers in your mouth, open up your blouse
Pull your G-string down South
Threw that back out, in the parking lot
By a Cherokee and a green drop-top
And I don't stop, until I squirt
Jeans, skirt, butt-naked, it all work
You nasty boy, you nasty
You nasty boy, you nasty
You nasty boy, you nasty
You nasty boy, nigga you so nasty
I remember we went to Tennessee
Then we came home, mad messages was on my phone
Bitch named Simone
Screamin, she fiendin for the semen
Me bein the man that I am
Took it to her condo pronto
Half Indian, I called her Tonto
Roll the chron'chron' in the dark pronto
Few puffs, eyes got low
And off to the bedroom we go
Sex is drama, head is trauma
Ripped pajamas, I'ma stay'til tomorrow
Satisfying all my needs twice
With whipped cream, handcuffs and ice
The bitch is nice, word is bond
Can't wait to put my niggas on, what? What? 
Ladies, my Mercedes
Hold fo' in the back, two if you're fat
Keep a gat cause cats try to test me
They just fans like De
Niro/Wesley
Let's see, the bitch I'm waitin on
Gardeur jeans look like they painted on
Ask thee, leave it up to me
Lay her on back ever so gently
She like the way the dough fold up, Rolls roll up
Cristal till she throw up, bitch grow up
Hold up, there's De
Genero
Dripped out, iceberg apparel
Intro goes without speaking
Call me Cease cause I keep em, we can go freakin
All weekend, so, roll in
Ain't it good that my Lex seats foldin? Uhh
Baby, look at me, Mama love you
And I know you ain't no little boy no more
But you'll always be my baby
It seems like only yesterday I was holding you in my arms
Now look at you now big, but I worry about you
I worry about you all the time, hangin' out on the corner
All times at night with the cruel people
Baby, that ain't nothin' but trouble
I always taught you that you could have whatever you dream
Well, I want you to hold on to that dream, baby
Hold on to it real tight, ‘cause the sky's the limit
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen
How's everybody doing tonight? 
I'd like to welcome to the stage
The lyrically acclaimed
I like this young man, because when he came out
He came out with the phrase
He went from ashy to classy – I like that
So everybody in the house
Give a warm round of applause for the Notorious B.I.G
The Notorious B.I.G
Ladies and gentlemen, give it up for him y'all! 
A nigga never been as broke as me, I like that
When I was young I had two pair of Lees, 
The pin stripes and the gray, the one I wore on Mondays and Wednesdays
While niggas flirt I'm sewing tigers on my shirts, and alligators
You want to see the inside, I see you later
Here comes the drama, oh
That's that nigga with the fake, blaow
Why you punch me in my face? Stay in your place
Play your position, here come my intuition
Go in this nigga pocket, rob him while his friends watchin'
And hoes clockin', here comes respect
His crew's your crew or they might be next
Look at they man eye, big man, they never try
So we rolled with them, stole with them
I mean loyalty, niggas bought me milks at lunch
The milks was chocolate, the cookies, butter crunch
88 Oshkosh and blue and white dunks; pass the blunts! 
Sky is the limit and you know that you keep on
Just keep on pressing on
Sky is the limit and you know that you can have
What you want, be what you want
Sky is the limit and you know that you keep on
Just keep on pressing on
Sky is the limit and you know that you can have
What you want, be what you want
Have what you want, be what you want
I was a shame, my crew was lame
I had enough heart for most of them
Long as I got stuff from most of them
I's on, even when I was wrong I got my point across
They depicted me the boss, of course
My orange box-cutter make the world go round
Plus I'm fucking bitches, ain't my homegirls now
Start stacking, dabbled in crack, gun packing
Nickname Medina make the seniors tote my niñas
From gym class to English pass off a global
The only nigga with a mobile, can't you see like Total
Getting larger in waists and tastes
Ain't no telling where this felon is headin', just in case
Keep a shell at the tip of your melon, clear the space
Your brain was a terrible thing to waste
'88 on gates, snatch initial name plates
Smokin' spliffs with niggas, real-life beginner killers
Praying God forgive us for being sinners, help us out
Sky is the limit and you know that you keep on
Just keep on pressing on
Sky is the limit and you know that you can have
What you want, be what you want
Sky is the limit and you know that you keep on
Just keep on pressing on
Sky is the limit and you know that you can have
What you want, be what you want
Have what you want, be what you want
After realizin', to master enterprisin'
I ain't have to be in school by ten, I then
Began to encounter with my counterparts
On how to burn the block apart, break it down into sections
Drugs by the selections
Some use pipes, others use injections
Syringe sold separately, Frank the Deputy
Quick to grab my Smith & Wesson like my dick was missin'
To protect my position, my corner, my lair
While we out here, say the Hustlers Prayer
If the game shakes me or breaks me
I hope it makes me a better man, take a better stand
Put money in my mom's hand
Get my daughter this college grant
So she don't need no man
Stay far from timid, only make moves when your heart's in it
And live the phrase 
Sky's the limit
Motherfuckers
See you chumps on top
Sky is the limit and you know that you keep on
Just keep on pressing on
Sky is the limit and you know that you can have
What you want, be what you want
Sky is the limit and you know that you keep on
Just keep on pressing on
Sky is the limit and you know that you can have
What you want, be what you want
Have what you want, be what you want
Sky is the limit and you know that you keep on
Just keep on pressing on
Sky is the limit and you know that you can have
What you want, be what you want
Sky is the limit and you know that you keep on
Just keep on pressing on
Sky is the limit and you know that you can have
What you want, be what you want
Sky is the limit and you know that you keep on
The world is filled with pimps and hoes
We'll just talk about those I know
The world is mine, can't you see? 
I'm just trying to be all I can be
Now first come the cash, then come the ass
Then come big blunts with big chunks of hash
When I score with a whore, she be game for sure
Pimp so hard a nigga drag his mink on the floor
Won't you admit it? I ain't gotta talk because I live it
Any chick fuckin' with me, believe me, that's a privilege
I won't be satisfied til all my niggas get it
See, you hit it then I hit it. We get it back to split it
And Big be that nigga, we be flying through your hood
And hood rats scoping with their eyes on my goods
See, we date em like we hate em, see em like we don't need em
Treat em like we beat em, and never give up freedom
And we only give our number to selected few
And it's best that you never knew what good head'll do
Turn a freak to a bisexual
And if she's flexible, fuck the nigga next to you
When the Remy's in the system, ain't no telling
Will I fuck him? Will I diss him?  That's what these hoes yelling
I'm a pimp by blood, not relation
Y'all still chase em, I'll replace em
Drunk off Dom, silk and gators
Spitting words, make a bird tell they flock see you later
Whether drunk or high, skunk or Thai
Nigga play against some playa shit, slugs gon' fly
Ain't gon' lie, pimped out her SSI
Nigga don't ask why, just respect it
She bought me the necklace, the bracelet
The Benz-o - she laced it
Crib-o, got it, interior decorated
Now my popularity grew in each state
Now I got 2 in each state
Used to drink brew and eat steak
Now I pop bottles with models
Larger stakes on large estates
I had a whole lot of bitches in my lifetime
I been blessed with the game, always say the right lines
Had a few prostitutes, and if you knew the truth
They're like pimps, you can't let em do it to you! 
She ain't no sucker. I know that bitch, man
She wanna be a Pretty Woman loving a rich man
Now here you come, drop top riding
You ain't no pimp, fake nigga, stop lying
Pussy makes money, stick to the business
Think about the real motherfuckers that lived it
Street life, pimp shit, make the ho respect the game
You bought her diamonds and cars, trick, that's a shame
Say what you want, but I still figure
She left you cause you couldn't be like them real niggas
She was a hustler by nature and you was just faker
Than the average simps, found a badder pimp
Crazy ass man
I never would have bought that bitch all them cars
And all that shit you bought that ho, man
After I heard about what the bitch did nigga, knew the ho! 
Man I'm 30 years old, nigga
And that bitch was hoin' when I was in 9th grade and shit
Think about that: she been around then right? 
Shit, you just a rest haven for hoes, man
Just the first nigga that came along when the bitch got out the pen
Bitch only fuckin' with you cause you had a good ass job, nigga
Nerd...treat the bitch better than anybody ever treated her
Stupid ass nigga. She ain't nothing but a ho! 
Bet you fell in love with her man! 
You can't turn a ho into a housewife, fool
Every time you turn your back, that bitch is fuckin' with them gangstas
Eastside, Westside - these are my partners
Do that shit, you know what I'm talkin' bout nigga
I tell you about some real pimps and hoes
Tell you about these pimps and these hoes man, yeah I know a few, shit
Beyotch!
WORD? 
I'm gonna get you motherfucker you better watch your motherfuckin back
That's my word nigga
 Get the fuck outta here
Better watch your motherfuckin back
 Watch my back? WORD? 
I'm gonna get Biggie, I'm gonna kill Biggie
 You soft duke, you soft
Fuck all you niggas, you all ain't SHIT
Watch your motherfuckin back
 Eat a dick
 Jealousy's a motherfucker, you weak jealous motherfuckers! 
If you a jealous motherfucker, you just a weak motherfucker! 
See when you on top, motherfuckers just wanna bring you down! 
Motherfuckers don't even know you, and they don't like you
I dream filthy
My moms and pops mixed me with Jamaican Rum and Whiskey
Huh, what a set off
Shoulda pushed em dead off, wipe the sweat off
Cause in this world I'm dead off, squeeze lead off
Benz sped off, ain't no shook hands in Brook-lyn
Army fatigues bring fatigue, to enemies, look man
You wanna see me locked up, shot up
Moms crouched up over the casket, screaming bastard
Crying, know my friends is lying
Y'all know who killed'em filled'em with the lugers from they Rugers
Or their Desert, dying ain't the shit but it's pleasant
Kinda quiet, watch my niggas bring the riot
Giving cats the opposite of diets
You gain thirty pounds when you die no lie, lazy eye
I was high when they hit me, took a few cats with me
Shit, I need the company
Apologies in order, to T'Yanna my daughter
If it was up to me you would be with me
Sorta like Daddy Dearest, my vision be the clearest
Silencers so you can't hear it
Competition still fear it, shit don't ask me
I went from ashy to nasty to classy, and still
That's not all, MC's have the gall 
To pray and pray for my downfall 
Pray and pray for my downfall 
Pray and pray for my downfall 
This goes out to cats, fingers in they ass again
Fifty dollar half-a-men, daydreaming
Fuck around get wet like semen, your whole team and
Be more gone than Freeman
I took the cream and, moved to new places new faces
Fuck the screwfaces, cause when I flip
I make the papers, dangerous, we Goodfellas
Niggas can't bang with us, try to do me
My crew be unruly
Some old school cats that call gats toolies
Call blacks moolies, think it's cool to smoke woolies
And fuck without rubbers
Specialize in killing wives and grandmothers
Who ya trusting, shit
When Frank start busting, Frank start somethin
Killing ya gently, God meant me, to push a Bentley
Me and Sean Combs taking broads home
On the phone with the chip, these Cristal chicks
Bout to make our own porno flicks, my life's the shit
That's not all, MC's have the gall 
To pray and pray for my downfall 
Pray and pray for my downfall 
Pray and pray for my downfall 
That's not all, MC's have the gall 
To pray and pray for my downfall 
Pray and pray for my downfall 
Pray and pray for my downfall 
We used to hold the gold, now we floss with diamonds
Niggas want my team to stop shining
Pray my fame start declining
Whining like girlies 
We been around the world twice, all we got is mo' ice
And mo' nice, sacrifice your heart
Lexus with the automatic start
Fifty shots'll tear your club apart
Eating shrimp a la carte, with some bitches from Brussels
Eating clams and mussels
Octopus, pretty face no waist
I just want the bush, so I can mack it
Give her a package to push, cause I work them hoes
Pendejos I show you how to play them hoes
Can you just visualize it
Before I go to sleep I check the beds and the closet
So I can sleep safe, not too many keep a mill' in the briefcase
Infrareds help me sleep safe, but wait
That's not all, MC's have the gall 
To pray and pray for my downfall 
Pray and pray for my downfall 
Pray and pray for my downfall 
See, y'all motherfuckers live off of negativity
What y'all niggas need to get through your motherfucking heads
Is that, y'all fucking with some niggas that's on a higher
Motherfucking level -- we don't give a fuck
About what you think about us how you feel about us
What you got to say about us
We gon keep doing our motherfuckin thing
From now till the year three thousand bitches! 
You can't breathe, you can't sleep, you can't eat
Without thinking about us! 
And without thinking about us on your mind
We gon' haunt your asses motherfuckers! 
That's not all, MC's have the gall 
To pray and pray for my downfall 
Pray and pray for my downfall 
Pray and pray for my downfall 
See I told ya'll
I told ya’ll motherfuckers
I told ya’ll to stop
I prayed for you to stop
But you didn’t stop
And then we won’t stop
Time, time for you to die
As I kiss.. your.. ass.. goodnight
Time, time for you to die
As I kiss.. your.. ass.. goodnight
I make yo' mouthpiece obese like Della Reese
When I release, you lose teeth like Lil' Cease
Nigga please, blood floods your dungarees
And that's just the half of my warpath
Laugh now cry later, I rhyme greater
Than the average playa hater, and spectators
Buy my CD twice; they see me in the streets
They be like, 
Yo he nice, but that's on the low though
Be the cats with no dough, tried to play me at my show
I pull out fo'-fo's, and go up in they clothes
Short-change niggas, snort'caine niggas
Extortion came quicker, bought the Range nigga
Ya still tickle me, I used to be as strong as Ripple be
Til Lil' Cease crippled me
Now I play hard, like my girl's nipples be
The game sour like a pickle be, y'all know the rules
Move from BK to New Jeruz -- thinkin'bout
All the planes we flew, bitches, we ran through
Now the year's new, I lay my game flat
I want my spot back, take two
Motherfuckers mad cause I blew, niggas envious
Too many niggas on my dick, shit strenuous
When my men bust, you just move with such stamina
Slugs missed ya, I ain't mad at cha 
Blood rushin', concussions, ain't nothin
Catch cases, come out fronting, smokin somethin
Sippin' White Russians, bitch in the Benz bumpin'
I laced it with the basic, six TVs a system
Knockin' Mase shit, face it, we hard to hit
Guard ya shit,'fore I stick you, for your re-up
Wipe the pee up, lick shots, woke your seed up
Go in the ashtray, spark the weed up
Long kiss
Hell, we don’t give a fuck
We just absolutely don’t give a fuck because
There ain’t no love here
There ain’t no love here
You know, we gon' keep doin' what we do
We gon' keep fuckin' you up
I’ll be stomping your motherfucking head in, you fucking bitch
Uhh.. I'm flamin' gats, aimin' at, these fucking
Maniacs, put my name in raps, what part the
Game is that? Like they hustle backwards
I smoke Backwoods and Dutchies, you can't touch me
Try to rush me, slugs go, touchy-touchy
You're bleeding lovely, wit'chyo, spirit above me
Or beneath me, your whole life you live sneaky
Now you rest eternally, sleepy, you burn when you creep me
Rest where the worms and the weak be
My nine flies, baptize, rap guys
With the Holy Ghost, I put holes in most
You hold your toast shaky, slippin' tryin to break me
Look what you made me do, brains blew
My team in the marine-blue, six Coupe
Skied it out, weeded out, cleanin' out -- the block
For distances, givin' long kisses BITCH! 
Only understand, I say a prayer for you
You know, that’s the only thing I can do, just pray for your mind
Because, see, your mind is in control of your heart
Where its supposed to be the other way around
Your heart has got to control your mind
So now, I have no feelings for you
You have made me cold
Frank White the menacing, Chron Chron's the medicine
I got the lettuce and, you turn green like cucumber skin
Got the new, Hummer in the summer when I was a new comer
Then, drugs and MAC-10s
Hugs from fake friends, make ends they hate you
Be broke -- girls won't date you
That's why I relate to, choke yo' ass out til your face blue
Make you, open the safe too
No matter how you call it 
This brolic, alcoholic
Like his weed green'd out, like his brick solid
Distribute to, kids who, take heart like Valentine
Drink Ballantine, all the time
Slugs hit your chest tap you spine, flatline
Heard through the grapevine, you got fucked fo' times
Damn that three to nine, fucked you up for real though
Sling steel slow, as for remorse, we feel no
See the fucked up thing is that I love you
You know what I’m saying
It’s just in my nature to love you
I can’t hate you
‘Cause its not in my nature to hate you
You know, I don’t know
Maybe I’m a different type of individual
But you have me on a line
And there’s a thin line between love and hate
And God-forbid I cross that line
Cause I’m not gon’ give a fuck
I’m telling you right motherfucking now
The shit that ya’ll done started
Is never gonna stop! 
We are never gonna stop! 
And we’re not talking about no other rappers
We’re talking about you, motherfucker! 
You know who I’m talking to
We comin' for you
We comin' for you
Laughs
Feels so good
I'ma make you love me baby, baby
Yea though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death
I will fear no evil -- for you are with me
Your rod and your staff, they comfort me
You prepare a table for me, in the presence of my enemies
You anoint my head with oil, my cup overflows
Surely goodness and love will follow me -- all the days of my life
And I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever
Niggas in my faction don't like asking questions
Strictly gun-testing, coke-measuring
Giving pleasure in the Benz-ito
Hitting fanny, spending chips at Manny's
Hope you creeps got receipts, my peeps get dirty like cleats
Run up in your crib, wrap you up in your Polo sheets
6 up in your wig-piece, nigga decease
Muah, may you rest in peace
With my Sycamore style, more sicker than yours
.44 and 54 draw
There's my pilot, steers my Lear; yes, my dear
Shit's official, only the Feds I fear
Here's a tissue, stop your blood clot crying
The kids, the dog, everybody dying -- no lying
So don't you get suspicious
I'm Big Dangerous you're just a Lil Vicious
As I leave my competition, respirator style
Climb the ladder to success escalator style
Hold y'all breath, I told y'all -- death
Controls y'all, Big don't fold y'all
I spit phrases that'll thrill you
You're nobody til somebody kills you
You're nobody til somebody kills you
Watch Casino, I'm the hip-hop version of Nicky Tarantino
Ask Nino, he know
Green with envy, the green tempts me
To make the rich the enemy, and take their cheese
Take their spots, take their keys, make my faculty
Live happily ever after in laughter
Hah, never seen Cristal pour faster
And to those bastards, knuckleheads squeeze lead
3 of mine dead, nothing left to do
But tear they ass to shreds, leave em in bloodshed
Incidents like this I take trips
Lay up in Miami with Tamika and Tammy 
Some Creole C-O bitches I met on tour
Push a peach Legend Coupe, gold teeth galore
Told me meet em in the future later, they'll take me shopping
Buy me lavender and fuschia Gators
Introduce me to player haters and heavy weighters
Rich bitch shit, drinking Cristal
Til they piss the shit, uhh
Thorough bitches, adapt to any borough bitches
Be in spots where they were no bitches, you feel me
Reminisce on dead friends too
You're nobody til somebody kills you
You can be the shit, flash the fattest 5
Have the biggest dick, but when your shell get hit
You ain't worth spit, just a memory
Remember he used to push the champagne Range 
Silly cat, wore suede in the rain
Swear he put the G in game, had the Gucci frame
Before Dana Dane, thought he ran with Kane
I can't recall his name, you mean that kid
That nearly lost half his brain over two bricks of cocaine? 
Getting his dick sucked by Crackhead Lorraine? 
A fucking shame, dude's the lame, what's his name? 
Darkskin Jermaine, see what I mean?
Shaolin shadowboxing and the Wu-Tang sword style. If what you say is true, the Shaolin and the Wu-Tang could be dangerous. Do you think your Wu-Tang sword can defeat me? 
En garde, I'll let you try my Wu-Tang style.
Bring da motherfuckin' ruckus!

Bring da mother, bring da motherfuckin' ruckus! 
Bring da motherfuckin' ruckus! 
Ghostface catch the blast of a hype verse
My Glock burst, leave in a hearse, I did worse
I come rough, tough like an elephant tusk
Your head rush, fly like Egyptian musk
Aww shit, Wu-Tang Clan spark the wicks, and
However I master the trick just like Nixon
Causin' terror, quick damage your whole era
Hardrocks is locked the fuck up or found shot
P.L.O. style, hazardous'cause I wreck this
Dangerous, I blow spots like Waco, Texas
I watch my back like I'm locked down
Hardcore-hittin' sound
Watch me act bugged and tear it down
Illiterate-type asshole, songs goin' gold
No doubt, and you watch a corny nigga fold
Yeah, they fake and all that, carryin' gats
But yo, my Clan rollin' like forty macks
Now you act convinced, I guess it makes sense
Wu-Tang, yo, soooo represent! 
I wait for one to act up, now I got him backed up
Gun to his neck now, react what? 
And that's one in the chamber, Wu-Tang banger
36 styles of danger
Bring da motherfuckin' ruckus!

I rip it hardcore, like porno-flick bitches
I roll with groups of ghetto bastards with biscuits
Check it, my method on the microphone's bangin'
Wu-Tang slang'll leave your headpiece hangin'
Bust this, I'm kickin' like Seagal: out for justice
The roughness, yes the rudeness, ruckus
Redrum, I verbally assault with the tongue
Murder one, my style shock your knot like a stun gun
I'm hectic, I wreck it with the quickness
Set it on the microphone, and competition get blown
By this nasty-ass nigga, with my nigga the RZA
Charged like a bull and got pulled like a trigger
So bad, stabbin' up the pad with the vocab, crab
I scream on your ass like your dad, bring it on! 
Bring da motherfuckin' ruckus! 
Bring da motherfuckin' ruckus! 
Bring da mother, bring da motherfuckin' ruckus! 
Bring da motherfuckin' ruckus! 
Yo, I'm more rugged than slave man boots
New recruits, I'm fuckin' up MC troops
I break loose, and trample shit, while I stomp
A mudhole in that ass'cause I'm straight out the swamp
Creepin' up on site, now it's Fright Night
My Wu-Tang slang is mad fuckin' dangerous
And more deadly than the stroke of an axe
Choppin' through your back
Givin' bystanders heart attacks
Niggas try to flip, tell me, who is him? 
I blow up his fuckin' prism, make it a vicious act of terrorism
You wanna bring it, so fuck it, come on and bring the ruckus! 
And I provoke niggas to kick buckets
I'm wettin' cream, I ain't wettin' fame
Who sellin' cain? I'm givin' out a deadly game
I's not the Russian, it's the Wu-Tang crushin' roulette
Slip up and get fucked like Suzette
Bring da fuckin' ruckus! 
Bring da motherfuckin' ruckus! 
Bring da motherfuckin' ruckus! 
En garde, I'll let you try my Wu-Tang style.
So, bring it on! So, bring it on!

I put the fuckin' buck in the wild kid, I'm terror, razor sharp, I sever
The head from the shoulders, I'm better than my competta
You mean competitor, whatever, let's get together
Shame on a nigga who try to run game on a nigga
Wu buck wild with the tri-BLOW! 
I react so thick, I'm phat, and yo
Rae came blowin' and blew off your headphones, black
Rap from, yo, Cali to Texas

Warriors, come out and play! 
Burn me, I get into shit, I let it out like diarrhea

Murder, taste the flame of the Wu-Tang
Rah! Here comes the Tiger vs. Crane

Thirty-six chambers of death
Three-hundred and sixty degrees of perfected styles
Choppin' off your motherfuckin' dome
-piece, and every fuckin' borough
Brooklyn, Manhattan, and Queens, Staten Island
The motherfuckin' Bronx, Killa Beez
The sword? C'mon, give him the sword! 
Clan in da front, let your feet stomp
Niggas on the left, rag shit to death
Hoods on the right, wild for the night
Punks in the back, come on in the track to what
The Wu is comin' through, the outcome is critical
Fuckin' with my style is sort of like a miracle
On 34th Street, in the Square of Herald
I gamed Ella, the bitch caught a Fitz like Gerald-
-ine Ferraro, who's full of sorrow
'Cause the ho didn't win, but the sun will still come out tomorrow
And shine shine shine like gold mine
Here comes the drunk monk, with a quart of Ballantine
Pass the bone, kid, pass the bone! 
Let's get on this mission like Indiana Jones
The GZA, one who just represent the Wu-Tang clique
With the game and soul of an old school flick
Like the Mack and Dolemite, who both did bids
Claudine went to Cooley High and had mad kids
So stop, the life you save may be your motherfuckin' own
I'll hang your ass with this microphone
Make way for the merge of traffic
Wu-Tang's comin' through with full metal jackets
God squad that's mad hard to serve
Come frontin' hard, then Bernhard Goetz what he deserves
Clan in da front, let your feet stomp
Niggas on the left, rag shit to death
Hoods on the right, wild for the night
Punks in the back, come on in the track to what
No response while I bomb that ass
You ain't shit, your wack-ass town had you gassed
Egos is somethin' the Wu-Tang crush
Souped-up niggas on a stage get rushed
I don't give a goddamn on the shows you did
How many rhymes you got or who knows you, kid
'Cause I don't know you, therefore show me what you know
I come sharp as a blade and I cut you slow
You become so Pat as my style increases
What's that in your pants? Ahh, human feces! 
Throw your shitty drawers in the hamper
Next time, come strapped with a fuckin' Pamper
How you sound, B? You're better off a quitter
I'm on the mound, G, and it's a no-hitter
And my DJ, the catcher, he's my man
In a way he's the one who devised the plan
He throws the signs, I hook up the beats with clout
I throw the rhymes to the mic and I strike'em out
So it really doesn't matter on how you intrigue
You can't fuck with those in the major leagues
Clan in da front, let your feet stomp

Nah, shorty, get you open like six packs
Killa Beez attack, flippin' what, murder one
Phat tracks, aight, I kick it like a Nike Flight
Word life, I get that ass robbed on spite

Just like rockin' what? Twin Glocks! 
Shake the ground while my beats just break you down
Raw sound, goin' to war right now
So, yo, bombin', We Usually Take All Niggas Garments
Save your breath before I vomit
I be that insane nigga from the psycho ward
I'm on the trigger, plus I got the Wu-Tang sword
So how you figure that you can even fuck with mine? 
Hey, yo, RZA! Hit me with that shit one time! 
And pull a foul, niggas, save the beef for the cow
I'm milkin' this ho, this is my show, Tical
The fuck you wanna do for this mic piece, duke? 
I'm like a sniper, hyper off the ginseng root
PLO Style, buddha monks with the owls
Now who's the fuckin' man? Meth-Tical
On the chessbox
Wu-Tang style
I leave the mic in body bags, my rap style has
The force to leave you lost like the tribe of Shabazz
Murderous material made by a madman
I's the mic wrecker, Inspectah, bad man
From the bad lands of the killer
Rap fanatic representin' with the skill that's iller
Dare to compare, get pierced just like your ear
The Shooby Doo-Wop pop, strictly hardware
Armed and geared,'cause I just broke out the prison
Charged by the system for murderin' the rhythm
Now lo and behold another deadly episode
Bound to catch another fuckin' charge when I explode
Slammin' a hype-ass verse'til your head burst
I ramshack dead in the track, and that's that
Rap assassin, fast and quick to blast and hardrock
I ran up in spots like Fort Knox
I'm hot, top notch, Ghost thinks with logic
Flashbacks how I attacked your whole project
I'm raw, I'm rugged and raw, I repeat
If I die, my seed'll be ill like me
Approachin' me, yo, out of respect, chops to neck
I get vexed, like crashin' up a phat-ass Lex
So, clear the way! Make way! Yo, open the cage! 
Peace, I'm out, jettin' like a runaway slave
You gettin' stripped from your garments, boy, run your jewels
All the meth got me open like fallopian tubes
I bring death to a snake when he least expect
Ain't a damn thing changed, boy, Protect Ya Neck
Ruler Zig-Zag-Zig Allah jam is fatal
Quick to stick my Wu-Tang sword right through your navel
Suspenseful force bein' brought through my utensil
The pencil, I bring strong winds up against you
Havoc, then run up through your county like the Maverick
Caps through the tablets, I gots to make the fabrics
A-a-a-ah-ah, are you a warrior killer slicin' shit like a samurai? 
The Ol' Dirty Bastard from the bar
Ol' Dirty clan of terrorists
Comin' at your ass like a sorceress, shootin' that piss
Niggas be gettin' on my fuckin' nerves
Rhymes they be kickin'
Make me wanna kick their fuckin' ass to the curb
Boy got funky fresh like the Old Specialist
A carrier, messenger, bury ya
This experience is for the whole experience
Let it be applied, Unique drop that science
M-M-My clan is thick like plaster, bust ya, slash ya
Slit a nigga back like a Dutch Master
Killer, style jumped off in Killa Hilla
I was the thriller in the Ali-Frazier Manila
I came down with phat tracks that combine and interlock
Like gettin' smashed by a cinder block
Pow! Now it's all over; niggas seein' pink hearts
Yellow moons, orange stars, and green clovers
Hey, you know, everybody's talking about the good old days,  right? Everybody! The good old days
Well, let's talk about the good old days! 
Know what I'm sayin'? 
Take you on this lyrical high real quick
1993 exoticness, know what I'm sayin'? 
Let's get technical; where's your bone at? 
Get up on that shit, a'ight? Yo! 
Started off on the island, aka Shaolin
Niggas wilin', gun shots thrown, the phone diallin'
Back in the days, I'm 8 now
Makin' a tape now, Rae gotta get a plate now
Ignorant and mad young, wanted to be the one
'Til I got  felt one
Yeah, my pops was a fiend since 16
Shootin' that that's that shit!  in his blood stream
That's the life of a grimy, real-life crimey
And niggas know that habit's behind me
Day one, yo, growin' all up in the ghetto
Now I'm a weed fiend jettin' to Palmetto
In Medina, yo, no doubt, the god got crazy clout
Pushin' the big joint from down South
So if you're filthy stacked up, better watch your back and duck
'Cause these fiends, they got it cracked up
Now my man from up North, now he got the loft
I's solid as a rock and crazy salt
No jokes, I'm not playin', get his folks
Desert Eagle his dick and put him in a yoke
And to know for sure, I got reck and rip shop
I pointed a gat at his mother's knot
Fuck that! 
Dedicated to the winners and the losers
Dedicated to the Lexus and the Ac's
Kickin' the fly clichés, doin' duets with Rae and A
Happens to make my day
Though I'm tired of bustin' off shots, havin' to rock knots
Runnin' up in spots and makin' shit hot
I'd rather flip shows instead of those
Hangin' on my livin' room wall, my first joint and it went gold! 
I want to lamp, I want to be in the shade
Plus the spotlight, gettin' my dick rode all night
I want to have me a phat yacht
And enough land to go and plant my own sess crops
But for now it's just a big dream
'Cause I find myself in a place where I'm last seen
My thoughts must be relaxed, be able to maintain
'Cause times is changed and life is strange
The glorious days is gone and everybody's doin' bad
Yo, mad lives is up for grabs
Brothers passin' away, I gotta make wakes
Receivin' all types of calls from Upstate
Yo, I can't cope with the pressure, settlin' for lesser
The God left lessons on my dresser
So I can bloom and blossom, find a new way
To continue to make more hits with Rae and A
Sunshine plays a major part in the daytime
Peace to mankind, Ghostface carry a black 9, nigga
Word up, it's all like that… yeah)
I's like this, I'ma start from the top
Inspectah Deck, he's like
He's like that dude that'll sit back and watch you
Play yourself and all that, right? 
And see you sit there and know you lyin'
And he'll take you to court after that
'Cause he the Inspectah, that's why he the and
And also he the Rebel I.N.S.
You know what I'm sayin'? 
And Shallah Raekwon, he the Chef
He cookin' up some marvelous shit to get your mouth waterin'
On some oh shit
Then, then it's, then it's the Method Man
I's like mad different methods to the way I do my shit
You gotta smoke a bean in here, anyhow
And I'm tellin' you, mine
Basically Method Man is like
Roll that shit, light that shit, smoke it
And then Baby U, he a psychopathic
He a psychopathic thinker
And and, then we got, then we got the Ol' Dirty Bastard
'Cause there ain't no father to his style
That's why he the Ol' Dirty Bastard
Ghostface Killah, you know what I'm sayin'? 
He on some now you see me, now you don't
Know what I'm sayin'? And and, the RZA
He the sharpest motherfucka in the whole Clan
He always on point, razor sharp
With the beats, with the rhymes, whatever, any DJ
And the GZA, the G is just the Genius
He, he's the backbone of the whole shit
I's self-explanatory, Genius, word
He the head, let's put it that way
We form like Voltron, and GZA happen to be the head
You know what I'm sayin'? 
Yeah, yeah, that's cool
So what's like, I mean what's like
Your ultimate goal against in this in this industry? 
Domination, baby, fuck that
Can I say this one? Can I say this one? 
Right now, right now, we still, we still
Feel like we ain't get what we want yet
When we get, when we get, when we get a little props
And really really get the way we gotta go
That's when you know it's on
You know what I'm sayin'? 
'Cause right about now, I ain't braggin' or nothin'
But yo, the Wu, the Wu got somethin'
That I know that everybody wanna hear
'Cause I know I've been waitin' to hear
You know what I'm sayin'? 
But straight up and down,'til we get the goal
We gon' keep goin'
Yeah,'cause we tryin' to do all this
We tryin' to make a business outta this, man
We ain't tryin' to-- know what I'm sayin'? 
Affiliate ourselves with them fake-ass A&Rs and all that
We tryin' to make our own shit
So that when our children, word
So that when our children, all our seeds and whatever
They got somethin' for theyselves right there
We ain't tryin' to hop in and hop out right quick
Know what I'm sayin'? 
We out for the Gusto, and we gon' keep it raw
You know what I'm sayin'? 
A game of chess is like a swordfight:
You must think first before you move
Toad style is immensely strong
And immune to nearly any weapon
When it's properly used it's almost invincible
Raw I'ma give it to ya, with no trivia
Raw like cocaine straight from Bolivia
My hip-hop will rock and shock the nation
Like the Emancipation Proclamation
Weak MC's approach with slang that's dead
You might as well run into the wall and bang your head
I'm pushin' force, my force you're doubtin'
I'm makin' devils cower to the Caucasus Mountains
Well, I'm a sire, I set the microphone on fire
Rap styles vary and carry like Mariah
I come from the Shaolin slum, and the isle I'm from
Is comin' through with nuff niggas and nuff guns
So if you wanna come sweatin', stressin', contestin'
You'll catch a sharp sword to the midsection
Don't talk the talk if you can't walk the walk
Phony niggas are outlined in chalk
I'm mad vexed, it's what the projects made me
Rebel to the grain, there's no way to barricade me
Steamrollin' niggas like an 18 wheeler
With a drunk driver drivin', there's no survivin'
Rough like Timberland wear, yeah
Me and the Clan in'Yota Landcruisers out there
Peace to all the crooks, all the niggas with bad looks
Bald heads, braids, blow this hook
We pack chrome TEC's, nickel-plated MAC's
Black AC's, drug-dealin' styles in phat stacks
I only been a good nigga for a minute though
'Cause I got to get my props and win it, yo
I got beef with commercial-ass niggas with gold teeth
Lampin' in a Lexus, eatin' beef
Straight up and down, don't even bother
I got 40 niggas up in here now who kill niggas' fathers
My peoples, are you with me? Where you at? 
In the front, in the back, Killa Bees on attack
My peoples, are you with me? Where you at? 
Smokin' meth, hittin' cats on the block with the gats
Here I go, deep type flow
Jacques Cousteau could never get this low
I'm cherry bombin' shits… BOOM! 
Just warmin' up a little bit, vroom vroom
Rappinin' is what's happenin'
Keep the pockets stacked and then, hands clap and then
At the party when I move my body
Gotta get up and be somebody! 
Grab the microphone, put strength to the bone
DUH DUH DUH… enter the Wu-Tang zone
Sure enough when I rock that stuff
Huff? Puff? I'm gonna catch your bluff tuff
Rough, kickin' rhymes like Jim Kelly
Or Alex Haley, I'm a Mi-…Beetle Bailey rhymes
Comin' raw style, hardcore
Niggas be comin' to the hip-hop store
Comin' to buy grocery from me
Tryin' to be a hip-hop MC
The law, in order to enter the Wu-Tang
You must bring the Ol' Dirty Bastard type slang
Represent the GZA, Abbot
RZA, Shaquan, Inspectah Deck
Dirty Ol' gettin' low with his flow
Introducin' the Ghostface Killah
No one could get iller
My peoples, are you with me? Where you at? 
In the front, in the back, Killa Beez on attack
My peoples, are you with me? Where you at? 
Smokin' meth, hittin' cats on the block with the gats
Speakin' of the Devil, psych! 
No, it's the God, get the shit right
Mega trife, and yo, I killed you in a past life
On the mic while you was kickin' that fast shit
You reneged, tried again and got blasted
Half-mastered-ass style, mad ruff task
When I struck I had on Timbs and a black mask
Remember that shit? I know you don't remember jack
That night, yo, I was hittin' like a spiked bat
And then you thought I was bugged out, and crazy
Strapped for nonsense, after me became lazy
Yo, nobody budge while I shot slugs
Never shot thugs, I'm runnin' with thugs that flood mugs
So, grab your 8 plus 1
Start flippin' and trippin', niggas is jettin', I'm lickin' off, son
Wu-Tang! Wu-Tang! Wu-Tang! Wu-Tang! 
Homicide's illegal and death is the penalty
One justifies the homicide when he dies in his own iniquity? 
I's the master of the Mantis Rapture comin' at ya
We have an APB on an MC Killer
Looks like the work of a master
Evidence indicates that his stature
Merciless like a terrorist hard to capture
The flow changes like a chameleon
Plays like a friend and stabs you like a dagger
This technique attacks the immune system
Disguised like a lie, paralyzin' the victim
You scream as it enters your bloodstream
Erupts your brain from the pain these thoughts contain
Movin' on a nigga with the speed of a centipede
And injure any motherfuckin' contender
My peoples, are you with me? Where you at? 
In the front, in the back, Killa Beez on attack
My peoples, are you with me? Where you at? 
Smokin' meth, hittin' cats on the block with the gats
Tiger Style! 
Wu-Tang Clan Ain't Nuthing ta Fuck Wit
Wu-Tang Clan Ain't Nuthing ta Fuck Wit
Wu-Tang Clan Ain't Nuthing ta Fuck Wit
Yo, there's no place to hide as I step inside the room
Dr. Doom, prepare for the boom
Bam! Aw, man! I slam, jam, now scream like Tarzan
I be tossin' and flossin', my style is awesome
I'm causin' more family feud than Richard Dawson
And the survey said you're dead
Fatal Flying Guillotine chops off your fuckin' head
MZA, who was that? Ayo, the Wu is back
Makin' niggas go Bo! Bo! like I'm Super Cat
Me fear no one, oh no, here come
The Wu-Tang shogun, killer to my eardrum
Put the needle to the groove, I gets rude
And I'm forced to fuck it up
My style carries like a pick-up truck
Cross the clear blue yonder, sea to shinin' sea
I slam tracks like quarterback sacks from L.T.
Now why try and test the Rebel INS? 
Blessed since the birth, I earth-slam your best
'Cause I bake the cake, then take the cake
And eat it, too, with my crew while we head state to state
And if you want beef, then bring the ruckus! 
Wu-Tang Clan ain't nuthing ta fuck wit
Straight from the motherfuckin' slums that's busted
Wu-Tang Clan ain't nuthing ta fuck wit
Hah! Lebonon, step up, boy! 
Represent! Chop his head off, kid! 
The Meth will come out tomorrow
Styles, conditions, bizarre, bizarro
Flow, with more afro than Rollo
Comin' to a fork in the road, which way to go? Just follow
Meth is the legend, niggas is sleepy hollow
In fact I'm a hard act to follow
I dealt for dolo, Bogart comin' on through
Niggas is like, 
Oh my God, not you! 
Yes, I come to get a slice of the punk and the pie
Rather do than die, check my flavor
Comin' from the RZA, which is short for The Razor
Who make me reminisce true
Like déjà vu, I'm rubber, niggas is like glue
Whatever you say rubs off me sticks to you
Wu-Tang Clan Ain't Nuthing ta Fuck Wit
Wu-Tang Clan Ain't Nuthing ta Fuck Wit
Wu-Tang Clan Ain't Nuthing ta Fuck Wit
Wu-Tang Clan Ain't Nuthing ta Fuck Wit
Ahh-hah! Yeah! Representin' Brooklyn, Queens

Yo, niggas from The Source
My man Kelly Woo from the Gavin
Will Strickland, Jason Staton, yeah
True, true, my nigga Crown, what's goin' down, boy? 
We ain't nuthing ta fuck wit
The whole Texas mob, the Chicago mob
Niggas from Detroit, fuckin' California squadron
Comin' through, you know what I'm sayin'? 
The whole fuckin' West Coast to the whole East
Niggas from D.C., down in Maryland
All the way over there in Morgan State
Wu-Tang Clan ain't nuthing ta fuck wit
All over the whole fuckin' globe, comin' through, boy
Peace to the fuckin' Zulu Nation
Peace to all the Gods and the Earths, word is bond
Wu-Tang slang, choppin' heads, boy
It ain't safe no more, peace!
What that nigga want, God? 
Word up, look out for the cops though
Wu-Tang five finger shit
Cash rules-
Word up, two for fives over here, baby
Word up, two for fives, niggas got garbage down the way
Word up, know what I'm sayin'? 
Cash rules everything around me, C.R.E.A.M. get-
Yeah, check this old fly shit out, word up
Cash rules everything around me, C.R.E.A.M.
Get the money, dollar dollar bill, y'all
Take you on a natural joint
Here we here we go, check this shit, yo
I grew up on the crime side, the New York Times side
Stayin' alive was no jive
Had secondhands, Mom's bounced on old man
So then we moved to Shaolin land
A young youth, yo rockin' the gold tooth,'Lo goose
Only way I be gettin' the G off was drug loot
And let's start it like this, son
Rollin' with this one and that one
Pullin' out gats for fun
But it was just a dream for the teen who was a fiend
Started smokin' woolas at 16
And runnin' up in gates and doin' hits for high stakes
Makin' my way on fire escapes
No question I would speed for cracks and weed
The combination made my eyes bleed
No question I would flow off and try to get the dough all
Stickin' up white boys in ball courts
My life got no better, same damn'Lo sweater
Times is rough and tough like leather
Figured out I went the wrong route
So I got with a sick-ass clique and went all out
Catchin' keys from'cross seas
Rollin' in MPV's, every week we made forty G's
Yo, nigga, respect mine, or here go the TEC-9
Ch-chick-POW! Move from the gate now! 
Cash rules everything around me
C.R.E.A.M., get the money
Dollar dollar bill, y'all
Cash rules everything around me
C.R.E.A.M., get the money
Dollar dollar bill, y'all
I's been twenty-two long hard years, I'm still strugglin'
Survival got me buggin', but I'm alive on arrival
I peep at the shape of the streets
And stay awake to the ways of the world'cause shit is deep
A man with a dream with plans to make cream
Which failed; I went to jail at the age of fifteen
A young buck sellin' drugs and such, who never had much
Tryin' to get a clutch at what I could not
The court played me short, now I face incarceration
Pacin', goin' upstate's my destination
Handcuffed in the back of a bus, forty of us
Life as a shorty shouldn't be so rough
But as the world turned I learned life is hell
Livin' in the world no different from a cell
Every day I escape from Jakes givin' chase
Sellin' base, smokin' bones in the staircase
Though I don't know why I chose to smoke sess
I guess that's the time when I'm not depressed
But I'm still depressed, and I ask: what's it worth? 
Ready to give up so I seek the old Earth
Who explained workin' hard may help you maintain
To learn to overcome the heartaches and pain
We got stick-up kids, corrupt cops, and crack rocks
And stray shots, all on the block that stays hot
Leave it up to me while I be livin' proof
To kick the truth to the young black youth
But shorty's runnin' wild, smokin' sess, drinkin' beer
And ain't tryin' to hear what I'm kickin' in his ear
Neglected for now, but yo, it gots to be accepted
That what? That life is hectic
Cash rules everything around me
C.R.E.A.M., get the money
Dollar dollar bill, y'all
Cash rules everything around me
C.R.E.A.M., get the money
Dollar dollar bill, y'all
Niggas got to do what they got to do
To get through, know what I'm sayin'? 
Because you can't just get by no more
Word up, you gotta get over, straight up and down
Cash rules everything around me
C.R.E.A.M., get the money
Dollar dollar bill, y'all
Cash rules everything around me
C.R.E.A.M., get the money
Dollar dollar bill, y'all
 Yeahhh, torture, motherfucker, what? 
 What? I'll fuckin' – I'll fuckin' tie you to a fuckin' bedpost with your ass cheeks spread out and shit, right? Put a hanger on a fuckin' stove and let that shit sit there for like a half hour, take it off and stick it in your ass slow like
 Yeah, I'll fuckin' – yeah, I'll fuckin' lay your nuts on a fuckin' dresser, just your nuts layin' on a fuckin' dresser, and bang them shits with a spiked fuckin' bat
 Whassup? BLAOWW! !

 I'll fuckin' – I'll fuckin – I'll fuckin' hang you by your fuckin' dick off a fuckin' twelve sto-story building out this motherfucker
 I'll fuckin' – I'll fuckin' sew your asshole closed, and keep feedin' you and feedin' you, and feedin' you, and feedin' you
 Yo, roll the dice, yo, roll the dice
Yo, so it's goin' down like that, huh? Yeah? 
Niggas is whylin', check it out, kid

Hold up  I tawt I tat I putty tat

Of the diggy dog shit right here
Yippy yippy yay yippy yah yippy yo
Like Deck said, this ain't your average flow
Comin' like rah ooh ah achie kah
Tell me, how you like it so far, baby paw? 
The poetry's in motion coast to coast and
Rub it on your skin like lotion
What's the commotion? Oh my Lord
Another corn chopped by the Wu-Tang sword
Hey, hey, hey!  like Fat Albert
I's the Method Man, ain't no if ands about it
I's the Method
All right, y'all, get your White Owls
Get your meth, get your skins
Don't forget your forty
And we gonna do it like this
I got fat bags of skunk

And I'm about to go get lifted
Yes, I'm about to go get lifted
I got myself a forty
I got myself a shorty
And I'm about to go and stick it
Yes, I'm about to go and stick it, uhh
H-U-F-F, huff, and I puff
Blow like snow when the cold wind's blowin'
Zoom, I hit the mic like boom! 
Wrote a song about it, like to hear it? Here it goes
Question, what exactly is a panty raider? 
Ill behaviour savior or major flavor
All of the above, oh yeah, plus seducer
Also flam I'm the man, call me super
Not an average Joe with an average flow
Doin' average things with average hoes
Yo, I'm super, I'll make a bitch squirm
For my Super Sperm 
Check it, I give it to you raw butt-naked
I smell sess, pass the method
Let's get lifted as I kick ballistics
Missiles and shoot game like a pistol
Clip is loaded when I click bang dang
A Wu-Tang slug hits your brain
J-U-M-P, jump, and I thump
Make girls rumps like pump and Humpty Hump
Wow, the Shaolin style is all in me
Child, the whole damn isle is callin' me
P-A-N-T-Y R-A-I-D-E-R, mad raw, I don't cry
Meaning no one can burn or toss and turn me
Ooh, I be the super sperm
Chim chimmeny chim chim cherie
Freak a flow and flow fancy free
Now, how many licks does it take
For me to hit the Tootsie Roll center of a break? 
Peep and don't sleep the crew's mad deep
Wu-Tang, fadin' motherfuckers like bleach
So to each and every crew
You're clear like glass I can see right through
Your whole damn posse be catchin''em all,'cause you vic'd
And you didn't have friends to begin with, I'm…
The M-E-T-H-O-D, Man
M-E-T-H-O-D, Man
M-E-T-H-O-D, Man
Here I am, here I am, the Method Man
Straight from the slums of Shaolin
Wu-Tang Killa Beez on a swarm
​Word to mother, Method Man signin' off, peace​
Caller: 
So whassup, man? 
DJ: 
Coolin', man.
C: 
Chillin' chilin'? Yo, you know I had to call, you why right? 
DJ: 
Why? 
C: 
Because, you, I never ever call and ask you to play somethin', right? 
DJ: 
Yeah.
C: 
You know what I wanna hear, right? 
DJ: 
Whatchu wanna hear? 
C: 
I wanna hear that Wu-Tang joint.
DJ: 
Wu-Tang again? 
C: 
Ah yeah, again and again.
I smoke on the mic like 
Smokin' Joe Frazier
The hell-raiser, raisin' hell with the flavor
Terrorize the jam like troops in Pakistan
Swingin' through your town like your neighborhood Spider-Man
So uhh, tick tock and keep tickin'
While I get you flippin' off the shit that I'm kickin'
The Lone Ranger, code red: Danger
Deep in the dark with the art to rip the charts apart
The vandal too hot to handle
You battle, you're sayin' goodbye like Tevin Campbell
Roughneck, Inspectah Deck's on the set
The Rebel, I make more noise than heavy metal
The way I make the crowd go wild
Sit back, relax, won't smile
Rae got it goin' on, pal
Call me the rap assassinator
Rhymes rugged and built like Schwarzenegger
And I'ma get mad deep like a threat
Blow up your project, then take all your assets
'Cause I came to shake the frame in half
With the thoughts that bomb shit like math
So if you wanna try to flip, go flip on the next man
'Cause I grab the clip and
Hit you with 16 shots and more, I got
Goin' to war with the meltin' pot, akh
I's the Method Man, for short Mr. Mef
Movin' on your left, UH! 
And set it off, get it off, let it off like a gat
I wanna break, fool, cock me back
Small change, they puttin' shame in the game
I take aim and blow the nigga out the frame
And like Fame my style will live forever
Niggas crossin' over, but they don't know no better
But I do, true, can I get a 
Suuu? 
Nuff respect due to the 1-6-oooh
I mean ohhh, yo, check out the flow
Like the Hudson or PCP when I'm dustin'
Niggas off, because I'm hot like sauce
The smoke from the lyrical blunt make me
Ooh, what, grab my nut, get screwed
Oww, here comes my Shaolin style
True B-A-ba-B-Y-U
To my crew with a 
Suuuuuuu
C'mon, baby baby, c'mon, baby baby
C'mon, baby baby, c'mon
Yo, you best protect ya neck
First things first, man, you're fuckin' with the worst
I'll be stickin' pins in your head like a fuckin' nurse
I'll attack any nigga who slack in his mack
Come fully packed with a fat rugged stack
Shame on you when you step through to
The Ol' Dirty Bastard straight from the Brooklyn Zu
And I'll be damned if I let any man
Come to my center, you enter the winter
Straight up and down, that shit is packed jam
You can't slam, don't let me get fool on him, man
The Ol' Dirty Bastard is dirty and stinkin'
Ason Unique rollin' with the night of the creeps
Niggas be rollin' with a stash, ain't sayin' cash
Bite my style, I'll bite your motherfuckin' ass
For cryin' out loud, my style is wild, so book me
Not long is how long that this rhyme took me
Ejectin' styles from my lethal weapon
My pen that rocks from here to Oregon
There's more again, catch it like a psycho flashback
I love gats; if Rap was a gun, you wouldn't bust back
I come with shit in all types of shapes and sounds
And where I lounge is my stompin' grounds
I give an order to my peeps across the water
To go and snatch up props all around the border
And get far like a shootin' star
'Cause who I are is dim in the light of Pablo Escobar
Point-blank as I kick the square biz
There it is, you're fuckin' with pros, and there it goes
Yo, chill with the feedback, black, we don't need that
I's 10 o'clock, ho, where the fuck's your seed at? 
Feelin' mad hostile, wearin' Aéropostale
Flowin' like Christ when I speaks the gospel
Stroll with the holy robe, then attack the globe
With the buck-us style, the ruckus
Ten times ten men committin' mad sin
Turn the other cheek and I'll break your fuckin' chin
Slayin' boom-bangs like African drums
 comin' around the mountain when I come
Crazy flamboyant for the rap enjoyment
My clan increase like black unemployment
Yeah, another one dare
Ju-Jugger-Genius, take us the fuck outta here
The Wu is too slammin' for these Cold Killin' labels
Some ain't had hits since I seen Aunt Mabel
Be doin' artists in like Cain did Abel
Now they money's gettin' stuck to the gum under the table
That's what you get when you misuse what I invent
Your empire falls and you lose every cent
For tryna blow up a scrub
Now that thought was just as bright as a 20-watt light bulb
Should've pumped it when I rocked it
Niggas so stingy they got short arms and deep pockets
This goes on in some companies
With majors, they're scared to death to pump these
First of all, who's your A&R? 
A mountain climber who plays an electric guitar? 
But he don't know the meanin' of dope
When he's lookin' for a suit-and-tie rap
That's cleaner than a bar of soap
And I'm the dirtiest thing in sight
Matter of fact, bring out the girls, and let's have a mud fight! 
You best protect ya neck
You best protect ya neck
You best protect ya neck
You best protect ya neck
After laughter comes tears
Check the script, me and the gods gettin' ripped
Blunts in the dip, forty dogs in my lip
Had a box,'boom boom' the bass would blast
We was laughin' at all the girls that passed
Conversation, brothers had began to discuss
Aw yeah, he ran, but he didn't get far
'Cause I dropped him, heh heh heh heh heh ha
Not knowin' exactly what lied ahead
My little brother, my mother sent him out for bread
Get the Wonder, it's a hot day in the summer
Didn't expect to come across a crazy gunner
Hey, Shorty, check it for the bag and the dough! 
But he was brave, looked him in the eye, and said 
No! 
Money splattered him, BOW! Then he snatched the bag
Hit his pockets, then he jetted up the Ave
Girls screamin', the noise up and down the block
 What? 
I ran frantically, then I dropped down to his feet
I saw the blood all over the hot concrete
I picked him up, then I held him by his head
His eyes shut, that's when I knew he was…
Aw man! How do I say goodbye? 
I's always the good ones that have to die
Memories in the corner of my mind
Flashbacks, I was laughin' all the time
I taught him all about the bees and birds
But I wish I had a chance to sing these three words
After laughter comes tears
Me and my man, my ace Big Moe from the shelter
'Bout to hit the skins from this girl named Thelma
Now, Thelma had a rep that was higher than her neck
Every girl from Shaolin dissed her respect
We was stimmy, you know how it is when you're blitzed
Three o'clock in the mornin', somethin' got to give
Moe said he'll go first, I said I'll take next
Here, take this raincoat and practice safe sex! 
He seemed to ignore, I said, 
Be for real! 
She's not even worth it to go raw deal.
A man's gonna do what a man's gonna do
He got butt-naked and stuck the power U
Twenty minutes went by, Moe, I'm out without a doubt
I'm not pumpin' up, I am airin' out
Hey yo, he came out laughin' with glory
I'm surprised he's still livin' to tell his story
But he carried on with the same old stuff
With Stephanie, like a Whammy, he pressed his luck
Moe tried to be down with O.P.P.
Ain't nothin' wrong, but he got caught with the H.I.V.
Now no life to live, doc says two more years
So after the laughter I guess comes the tears
After laughter comes tears
Niggas on the left, brag shit to death
Now hoods on the right, wild for the night
Punks in the back, c'mon and attract to what
Clan in da front, let your feet stomp
Niggas on the left, brag shit to death
Hoods on the right, wild for the night
Punks in the back, c'mon and attract to what
This goes back to nineteen..
Ahem, check it, yo
GOOD MORNING VIETNAM! ! 
Yeah, good morning to all you motherfuckin notty-headed niggas
Word to the camoflouge large niggas

Champion gear that I rock, you get your boots knocked
Then attack you like a pit that lock shit DOWN

Nah shorty, get you open like six packs
Killer Bees attack, flippin what, murder one, phat tracks

Word life, I get that ass raw, I'm fulla spite! 
Check the method from Bedrock, cause I rock ya head to bed
Just like rockin what? Twin Glocks! 
Shake the ground while my beats just break you down
Raw sound, we going to war right now
So, yo, bombin
We Usually Take All Niggas Garments
Save ya breath before I vomit
I be that insane nigga from the psycho ward
I'm on the trigger, plus I got the Wu-Tang sword
So how you figure that you can even fuck with mine? 
Hey, yo, RZA! Hit me with that shit one time! 
And pull a foul, niggas save the beef on the cow
I'm milkin this ho, this is MY show, tical
The FUCK you wanna do? More than Spike Lee's Do
I'm like a sniper, hyper off the ginseng root
PLO style, buddha monks with the owls
So who's the fucking man? Meth-Tical
On the chessbox
Yo, yeah, yo
I leave the mic in body bags, my rap style has
The force to leave you lost, like the tribe of Shabazz
Murderous material, made by a madman
I's the mic wrecker, Inspector, bad man
From the bad lands of the killer, rap fanatic
Representing with the skill that's iller
Dare to compare, get pierced just like an ear
The zoo-we-do-wop-bop strictly hardware
Armed and geared cause I just broke out the prison
Charged by the system - for murdering the rhythm! 
Now, lo and behold, another deadly episode
Bound to catch another fuckin charge when I explode
Slammin a hype-ass verse til ya head burst
I ramshack dead in the track, and that's that
Rap assassin, fastin, quick to blast and hardrock
I ran up in spots like Fort Knox! 
I'm hot, top notch, Ghost thinks with logic
Flashback's how I attacked your whole project
I'm raw, I'm rugged and raw! I repeat, if I die
My seed'll be ill like me
Approachin me, you out of respect, chops ya neck
I get vexed, like crashing up a phat-ass Lex'
So clear the way, make way, yo! Open the cage
Peace, I'm out, jettin like a runaway slave
Ya gettin stripped from ya garments, boy, run ya jewels
While the meth got me open like falopian tubes
I bring death to a snake when he least expect
Ain't a damn thing changed, boy, Protect Ya Neck
Ruler Zig Zag, Zig-Allah jam is fatal
Quick to stick my Wu-Tang sword right through ya navel
Suspenseful, plus bein bought through my utensil
The pencil, I break strong winds up against your
Abbot, that run up through your county like the Maverick
Caps through the tablets, I gots to make the fabrics
Are uh-ah-uh Are you a warrior? Killer? Slicin shit like a samurai
The Ol' Dirty Bastard from the bar
Ol' Dirty clan of terrorists
Comin atcha ass like a sorceress, shootin' that PISS! 
Niggas be gettin on my fuckin nerves
Rhymes they be kickin make me wanna kick they fuckin ass to the curb
I got funky fresh, like the old specialist
A carrier, messenger, bury ya
This experience is for the whole experience
Let it be applied, and THEN DROP THAT SCIENCE
My my my
My Clan is thick like plaster
Bust ya, slash ya
Slit a nigga back like a Dutch Master Killer
Style jumped off and Killa, Hill-er
I was the thriller in the Ali-Frazier Manilla
I came down with phat tracks that combine and interlock
Like getting smashed by a cinder block
Blaow! Now it's all over
Niggas seeing pink hearts, yellow moons
Orange stars and green clovers Yo butter butter
 Protect Ya Neck baby
 Respect due pa
 Peace
 Peace
 Word up Wu-Tang in the house though
 I guess alot of people in ya
I guess they can feel the realness you
They could feel the vibe
And I think hip hop, that's what I be tellin a lot of people
A lot of record promoters and a lot of artists
I mean it's like, it's music that you gotta touch and feel
You know what I'm sayin'
And I think that comes across well in the video
I haven't seen you live yet, I'm waitin for the chance
But I'm pretty sure that's probably what's it like
You know you probably really get into it
I guess I hear it in your voices when you sayin the rhymes
Um, what ya say ya style is? 
I's a secret! Never teach the Wu-Tang
You best protect ya neck
Street's disciple, my raps are trifle
I shoot slugs from my brain just like a rifle
Stampede the stage, I leave the microphone split
Play Mr. Tuffy while I'm on some Pretty Tone shit
Verbal assassin, my architect pleases
When I was 12, I went to…
And you're sitting at home doing this shit
I should be earning a medal for this
Stop fuckin' around and be a man
There ain't nothin' out here for you
Oh yes, there is… This
Yo, Nas, yo, what the fuck is this bullshit on the radio, son? 
Chill, chill! That's the shit, God, chill
Ayo, yo, pull down the shade, man
Let's count this money, nigga
Ayo, Nas, put the Jacksons and the Grants over there! 
You know what I'm sayin'? 
‘Cause we spendin' the Jacksons
You know how we get down, baby
True, true
Nas, yo, Nas, man
Shit is mad real right now in the projects
For a nigga, yo, word to mother
All them crab-ass rappers be comin' up to me
Man, word to mother, man
I think we need to let them niggas know it's real, man
True indeed, knamsayin'? 
But when it's real you doin' this
Even without a record contract, knamsayin'? 
No question
Been doing this since back then
I'm sayin' regardless how it go down we gon' keep it real
We tryin' to see many mansions and Coupes, kid
No doubt, we gon' keep it real, true, true
Ayo, where's Grand Wizard and Mayo at, man? 
Takin' niggas a long time, man
Who got the Phillies? Take this Hennessy
Ayo, dunn
C'mon, c'mon, man, stop wavin' that, man! 
Stop pointin' that at me, dunn, take the clip out! 
Nigga, alright, but take this Hennessy, man! 
I'm sayin' take the clip, man, c'mon, take it out! 
Light them Phillies up, man! 
Niggas stop fuckin' burnin' Phillies, man
Light some Phillies up then! 
Pass that henrock, pass that henrock! 
Nigga, act like you know! 
Yo, we drinkin' this straight up with no chaser
I ain't fuckin' with you, nigga
I'm saying though, man
What is it, what is it, baby? 
What is it, son, what is it? 
You know what time it is
I'm saying, man, you know what I'm saying? 
Niggas don't listen, man
Representin', it's Illmatic
Yeah, yeah
Ayo, Black, it's time, word 
I's time, man 
Straight out the fuckin' dungeons of rap
Where fake niggas don't make it back
I don't know how to start this shit, yo... now
Rappers, I monkey flip'em, with the funky rhythm I be kickin'
Musician, inflictin' composition of pain
I'm like Scarface sniffin' cocaine
Holdin' an M16, see with the pen I'm extreme
Now, bullet holes left in my peepholes
I'm suited up in street clothes
Hand me a 9 and I'll defeat foes
Y'all know my steelo with or without the airplay
I keep some E&J, sittin' bent up in the stairway
Or either on the corner bettin' Grants with the cee-lo champs
Laughin' at baseheads tryna sell some broken amps
G-packs get off quick, forever niggas talk shit
Reminiscin' about the last time the task force flipped
Niggas be runnin' through the block shootin'
Time to start the revolution, catch a body, head for Houston
Once they caught us off-guard, the MAC-10 was in the grass and
I ran like a cheetah, with thoughts of an assassin
Picked the MAC up, told brothers, 
Back up!  — the MAC spit
Lead was hittin' niggas, one ran, I made him backflip
Heard a few chicks scream, my arm shook, couldn't look
Gave another squeeze, heard it click, 
Yo, my shit is stuck! 
Try to cock it, it wouldn't shoot, now I'm in danger
Finally pulled it back and saw
Three bullets caught up in the chamber
So now I'm jettin' to the building lobby
And it was full of children prob'ly, couldn't see as high as I be
 I's like the game ain't the same
Got younger niggas pullin' the triggers, bringin' fame to their name
And claim some corners, crews without guns are goners
In broad daylight, stick-up kids, they run up on us
45's and gauges, MAC's in fact
Same niggas will catch you back-to-back
Snatchin' your cracks in black
There was a snitch on the block gettin' niggas knocked
So hold your stash'til the coke price drop
I know this crackhead who said she got to smoke nice rock
And if it's good, she'll bring you customers in measuring pots
But yo, you gotta slide on a vacation
Inside information keeps large niggas erasin' and their wives basin'
It drops deep as it does in my breath
I never sleep, ‘cause sleep is the cousin of death
Beyond the walls of intelligence, life is defined
I think of crime when I'm in a New York state of mind
New York state of mind
Be havin' dreams that I'm a gangsta
Drinkin' Moëts, holdin' TEC's
Makin' sure the cash came correct, then I stepped
Investments in stocks, sewin' up the blocks to sell rocks
Winnin' gunfights with mega-cops
But just a nigga walkin' with his finger on the trigger
Make enough figures until my pockets get bigger
I ain't the type of brother made for you to start testin'
Give me a Smith & Wesson, I have niggas undressin'
Thinkin' of cash flow, buddha and shelter
Whenever frustrated, I'm a hijack Delta
In the PJ's, my blend tape plays, bullets are strays
Young bitches is grazed, each block is like a maze
Full of black rats trapped plus the Island is packed
From what I hear in all the stories when my peoples come back
Black, I'm livin' where the nights is jet-black
The fiends fight to get crack
I just max, I dream I can sit back
And lamp like Capone, with drug scripts sewn
Or the legal luxury life, rings flooded with stones, holmes
I got so many rhymes, I don't think I'm too sane
Life is parallel to Hell, but I must maintain
And be prosperous, though we live dangerous
Cops could just arrest me, blamin' us: we're held like hostages
I's only right that I was born to use mics
And the stuff that I write is even tougher than dykes
I've taken rappers to a new plateau
Through rap slow, my rhymin' is a vitamin held without a capsule
The smooth criminal on beat breaks
Never put me in your box if your shit eats tapes
The city never sleeps, full of villains and creeps
That's where I learned to do my hustle, had to scuffle with freaks
I'm an addict for sneakers
20's of buddha and bitches with beepers
In the streets I can greet ya, about blunts I teach ya
Inhale deep like the words of my breath
I never sleep, ‘cause sleep is the cousin of death
I lay puzzle as I backtrack to earlier times
Nothing's equivalent to the New York state of mind
New York state of mind
Nasty Nas
Delete me! Me too!
Ayo, what's up, what's up? 
Let's keep it real, son, count this money
You know what I'm sayin'? Yeah yeah
Ayo, put the Grants over there in the safe
You know what I'm sayin'? 
‘Cause we spendin' these Jacksons
The Washingtons go to wifey, you know how that go
I'm sayin' that's what this is all about right
Clothes, bankrolls, and hoes
You know what I'm sayin'? 
Yo, then what man, what? ! 
Visualizin' the realism of life in actuality
Fuck who's the baddest, a person's status depends on salary
And my mentality is money-orientated
I'm destined to live the dream for all my peeps who never made it
‘Cause yeah, we were beginners in the hood as Five Percenters
But somethin' must've got in us, ‘cause all of us turned to sinners
Now some restin' in peace and some are sittin' in San Quentin
Others, such as myself, are tryin' to carry on tradition
Keepin' this Schweppervescent street ghetto essence inside us
'Cause it provides us with the proper insight to guide us
Even though we know, somehow we all gotta go
But as long as we leavin' thievin'
We'll be leavin' with some kind of dough
So, until that day we expire and turn to vapors
Me and my capers will be somewhere stackin' plenty papers
Keepin' it real, packin' steel, gettin' high
‘Cause life's a bitch and then you die
 
Life's a bitch and then you die
That's why we get high
‘Cause you never know when you're gonna go
Life's a bitch and then you die
That's why we puff lye
‘Cause you never know when you're gonna go
I woke up early on my born day; I'm 20, it's a blessin'
The essence of adolescence leaves my body, now I'm fresh and
My physical frame is celebrated ‘cause I made it
One quarter through life, some godly-like thing created
Got rhymes 365 days annual, plus some
Load up the mic and bust one, cuss while I pus from
My skull, ‘cause it's pain in my brain vein, money maintain
Don't go against the grain, simple and plain
When I was young at this I used to do my thing hard
Robbin' foreigners, take they wallets, they jewels and rip they green cards
Dipped to the projects, flashin' my quick cash
And got my first piece of ass, smokin' blunts with hash
Now it's all about cash in abundance
Niggas I used to run with is rich or doin' years in the hundreds
I switched my motto; instead of sayin', 
Fuck tomorrow! 
That buck that bought a bottle could've struck the lotto
Once I stood on the block, loose cracks produce stacks
I cooked up and cut small pieces to get my loot back
Time is illmatic, keep static like wool fabric
Pack a 4-matic to crack your whole cabbage
Life's a bitch and then you die
That's why we get high
‘Cause you never know when you're gonna go
Life's a bitch and then you die
That's why we puff lye
‘Cause you never know when you're gonna go
Life's a bitch and then you die
Delete me! Me too!
I's yours Whose world is this? 
The world is yours, the world is yours
I's mine, it's mine, it's mine—whose world is this? 
I's mine, it's mine, it's mine—whose world is this? 
The world is yours, the world is yours
I's mine, it's mine, it's mine—whose world is this? 
I sip the Dom P, watchin' Gandhi'til I'm charged, then
Writin' in my book of rhymes, all the words past the margin
Behold the mic I'm throbbin', mechanical movement
Understandable smooth shit that murderers move with
The thief's theme; play me at night, they won't act right
The fiend of hip-hop has got me stuck like a crack pipe
The mind activation, react like I'm facin'
Time like Pappy Mason, with pens I'm embracin'
Wipe the sweat off my dome, spit the phlegm on the streets
Suede Timbs on my feet makes my cipher complete
Whether cruisin' in a Six cab or Montero Jeep
I can't call it; the beats make me fallin' asleep
I keep fallin', but never fallin' six feet deep
I'm out for presidents to represent me 
I'm out for presidents to represent me 
I'm out for dead presidents to represent me
I's yours Whose world is this? 
The world is yours, the world is yours
I's mine, it's mine, it's mine — whose world is this? 
I's mine, it's mine, it's mine — whose world is this? 
The world is yours, the world is yours
I's mine, it's mine, it's mine — whose world is this? 
To my man Ill Will
God bless your life
To my peoples throughout Queens
God bless your life
I trip, we box up crazy bitches
Aimin' guns in all my baby pictures
Beef with housing police, release scriptures that's maybe Hitler's
Yet I'm the mild, money-gettin' style, rollin' foul
The versatile, honey-stickin', wild, golden child
Dwellin' in the Rotten Apple, you get tackled
Or caught by the devil's lasso, shit is a hassle
There's no days for broke days
We sell it, smoke pays, while all the old folks pray
To Jesús, soakin' their sins in trays of holy water
Odds against Nas are slaughter
Thinkin' a word best describin' my life to name my daughter
My strength, my son, the star will be my resurrection
Born in correction, all the wrong shit I did
He'll lead a right direction
How you livin'? Large, a broker charge, cards are mediocre
You flippin' coke or playin' spit, spades, and strip poker? 
I's yours Whose world is this? 
The world is yours, the world is yours
I's mine, it's mine, it's mine — whose world is this? 
I's mine, it's mine, it's mine — whose world is this? 
The world is yours, the world is yours
I's mine, it's mine, it's mine — whose world is this? 
I'm the young city bandit, hold myself down single-handed
For murder raps, I kick my thoughts alone, get remanded
Born alone, die alone; no crew to keep my crown or throne
I'm deep by sound alone, caved inside, 1, 000 miles from home
I need a new nigga for this black cloud to follow
‘Cause while it's over me it's too dark to see tomorrow
Tryin' to maintain, I flip, fill the clip to the tip
Picturin' my peeps not eatin' can make my heartbeat skip
And I'm amped up, they locked the champ up
Even my brain's in handcuffs
Headed for Indiana, stabbin' women like the Phantom
The crew is lampin', Big Willie style
Check the chip-toothed smile, plus I profile wild
Stash loot in fly clothes, burnin' dollars to light my stoge
Walk the blocks with a bop, checkin' dames
Plus the games people play bust the problems of the world today
I's yours Whose world is this? 
The world is yours, the world is yours
I's mine, it's mine, it's mine — whose world is this? 
I's mine, it's mine, it's mine — whose world is this? 
The world is yours, the world is yours
I's mine, it's mine, it's mine — whose world is this? 
Yeah, a'ight? 
To everybody in Queens, the foundation 
The world is yours
To everybody uptown, yo, the world is yours 
The world is yours
To everybody in Brooklyn
Y'all know the world is yours 
The world is yours
Everybody in Mount Vernon, the world is yours 
Long Island, the world is yours 
Staten Island, yeah, the world is yours 
South Bronx, the world is yours 
Aight
Check me out, y'all
Nasty Nas in your area
About to cause mass hysteria
Before a blunt, I take out my fronts
Then I start to front; matter of fact, I be on a manhunt
You couldn't catch me in the streets without a ton of reefer
That's like Malcolm X catching the Jungle Fever
King poetic; too much flavor, I'm major
Atlanta ain't Brave-r, I'll pull a number, like a pager
‘Cause I'm an ace when I face the bass
40-side is the place that is giving me grace
Now wait, another dose and you might be dead
And I'm a Nike-head, I wear chains that excite the Feds
And ain't a damn thing gonna change
I'm a performer, strange
So the mic warmer was born to gain
Nas, why did you do it? You know
You got the mad-phat fluid when you rhyme; it's halftime
I's halftime
This is how it feel
Check it out, how it feel
I's like that, you know it's like that
I got it hemmed, now you never get the mic back
When I attack, there ain't an army that could strike back
So I react never calmly on a hype track
I set it off with my own rhyme
‘Cause I'm as ill as a convict who kills for phone time
I'm max like cassettes, I flex like sex
In your stereo sets, Nas'll catch wreck
I used to hustle; now all I do is relax and strive
When I was young I was a fan of the Jackson 5
I drop jewels, wear jewels, hope to never run it
With more kicks than a baby in a mother's stomach
Nasty Nas has to rise, ‘cause I'm wise
This is exercise'til the microphone dies
Back in'83 I was an MC sparkin'
But I was too scared to grab the mics in the parks, and
Kick my little raps ‘cause I thought niggas wouldn't understand
And now in every jam I'm the fuckin' man
I rap in front of more niggas than in the slave ships
I used to watch 
CHi
Ps, now I load Glock clips
I got to have it, I miss Mr. Magic
Versatile, my style switches, like a faggot
But not bisexual; I'm an intellectual
Of rap I'm a professional, and that's no question, yo
These are the lyrics of the man
You can't near it, understand? 
‘Cause in the streets I'm well-known, like the number man
Am I in place with the bass and format? 
Explore rap and tell me, 
Nas ain't all that.
And next time I rhyme, I be foul
Whenever I freestyle I see trial, niggas say I'm wild
I hate a rhyme-biter's rhyme
Stay tuned, I assume; the real rap comes at halftime
I's halftime
This is how it feel
Check it out, how it feel
I got it going on, even flip a morning song
Every afternoon, I kick half the tune
And in the darkness, I'm heartless, like when the NARC's hit
Word to Marcus Garvey; I hardly sparked it
‘Cause when I blast the herb, that's my word
I be slayin' them fast, doing this that and the third
But chill, pass the Andre, and let's slay
I bag bitches up at John Jay, and hit a matinee
Putting hits on 5-0
‘Cause when it's my time to go, I wait for God with the.44
And biters can't come near
And yo, go to hell to the foul cop who shot Garcia
I won't plant seeds
Don't need an extra mouth I can't feed
That's extra Phillie change, more cash for damp weed
This goes out to Manhattan, the island of Staten
Brooklyn and Queens is living fat, and
The Boogie Down, enough props, enough clout
Ill Will, rest in peace! Yo, I'm out
Aight, fuck that shit! Word, word
Fuck that other shit, y'know what I'm sayin'? 
We gonna do a lil somethin' like this
Y'know what I'm sayin'? 
Keep it on and on and on and on and
Know'm sayin'? Big Nas, Grand Wizard, what is it? 
 Haha,  you know what I'm sayin'? 
Yo, go ahead and rip that shit, dun! 
I rap for listeners, bluntheads, fly ladies, and prisoners
Henessey-holders and old-school niggas, then I be dissin' a
Unofficial that smoke Woolie Thai
I dropped out of Cooley High
Gassed up by a cokehead cutie pie
Jungle survivor, fuck who's the live-er
My man put the battery in my back, a difference from Energizer
Sentence begins indented with formality
My duration's infinite, moneywise or physiology
Poetry, that's a part of me, retardedly bop
I drop the ancient manifested hip-hop straight off the block
I reminisce on park jams, my man was shot for his sheep coat
Chocolate blunts make me see him drop in my weed smoke
I's real, grew up in trife life, did times or white lines
The hype pipes, murderous nighttimes
And knife fights and blight crimes
Chill on the block with Cognac, hold strap
With my peeps that's into drug money market interact
No sign of the beast in the blue Chrysler
I guess that means peace
For niggas, no sheisty vice to just snipe ya
Start off the dice-rollin' mats for craps to cee-lo
With side-bets, I roll a deuce, nothin' below
 Peace God – now the shit is explained
I'm takin' niggas on a trip straight through memory lane
I's like that, y'all…
Now let me take a trip down memory lane
Comin' outta Queensbridge
One for the money, two for pussy and foreign cars
Three for Alizé, niggas deceased or behind bars
I rap divine, God, check the prognosis: is it real or showbiz? 
My window faces shootouts, drug overdoses
Live amongst no roses, only the drama
For real, a nickel-plate is my fate, my medicine is the ganja
Here's my basis, my razor embraces, many faces
You're telephone blown, black, stitches or fat shoelaces
Peoples are petro, dramatic automatic.44 I let blow
And back down po-po when I'm vexed so
My pen taps the paper, then my brain's blank
I see dark streets, hustlin' brothers who keep the same rank
Pumpin' for somethin', some'll prosper, some fail
Judges hangin' niggas, uncorrect bails for direct sales
My intellect prevails from a hangin' cross with nails
I reinforce the frail, with lyrics that's real
Word to Christ, a disciple of streets, trifle on beats
I decipher prophecies through a mic and say peace
I hung around the older crews
While they sling smack to dingbats
They spoke of Fat Cat; that nigga's name made bell rings, black
Some fiends scream about Supreme Team, a Jamaica Queens thing
Uptown was Alpo, son, heard he was kingpin
Yo, fuck, rap is real! 
Watch the herbs stand still
Never talkin' to snakes, ‘cause the words of man kill
True in the game, as long as blood is blue in my veins
I pour my Heineken brew to my deceased crew on memory lane
Now let me take a trip down memory lane
Comin' outta Queensbridge
Now let me take a trip down memory lane
Comin' outta Queensbridge
Comin' out of Queensbridge 
The most dangerous MC is…
Comin' out of Queensbridge
The most dangerous MC is…
Comin' out of Queensbridge
The most dangerous MC is…
Comin' out of Queensbridge
The most dangerous MC is…
Me number one, and you know where me from"
What up, kid? I know shit is rough doin' your bid
When the cops came you shoulda slid to my crib
Fuck it, black, no time for lookin' back, it's done
Plus, congratulations, you know you got a son
I heard he looks like ya, why don't your lady write ya? 
Told her she should visit, that's when she got hyper
Flippin', talkin' about he acts too rough
He didn't listen, he be riffin' while I'm tellin' him stuff
I was like, 
Yeah,  shorty don't care, she a snake too
Fuckin' with them niggas from that fake crew that hate you
But yo, guess who got shot in the dome-piece? 
Jerome's niece, on her way home from Jones Beach
I's bugged, plus little Rob is sellin' drugs on the dime
Hangin' out with young thugs that all carry 9's
And night time is more trife than ever
What up with Cormega? Did you see him? Are y'all together? 
If so, then hold the fort down, represent to the fullest
Say what's up to Herb, Ice and Bullet
I left a half a hundred in your commissary
You was my nigga when push came to shove
 One love! 
 One love, one love, one love, one love
One love, one love, one love, one love
One love, one love, one love, one love
One love, one love, one love, one love
Dear Born, you'll be out soon, stay strong
Out in New York the same shit is goin' on
The crackheads stalkin', loudmouths is talkin'
Hold, check out the story yesterday when I was walkin'
That nigga you shot last year tried to appear
Like he hurtin' somethin'
Word to mother, I heard him frontin'
And he be pumpin' on your block
Your man gave him your Glock
And now they run together — what up, son? Whatever
Since I'm on the streets I'ma put it to a cease
But I heard you blew a nigga with a ox for the phone piece
Wildin' on the Island, but now in Elmira
Better chill, ‘cause them niggas will put that ass on fire
Last time you wrote you said they tried you in the showers
But maintain, when you come home the corner's ours
On the reals, all these crab niggas know the deal
When we start the revolution all they probably do is squeal
But chill, see you on the next V-I
I gave your mom dukes loot for kicks, plus sent you flicks
Your brother's buckwildin' in 4-Main, he wrote me
He might beat his case,'til he come home he'll play it lowkey
So stay civilized, time flies
Though incarcerated your mind dies
I hate it when your moms cries
It kinda makes me want to murder, for reala
I even got a mask and gloves to bust slugs, but one love
One love, one love, one love, one love
One love, one love, one love, one love
One love, one love, one love, one love
One love, one love, one love, one love
Sometimes I sit back with a Buddha sack
Mind's in another world, thinkin'
How can we exist through the facts? 
Written in school text books, bibles, et cetera
Fuck a school lecture, the lies get me vexed-er
So I be ghost from my projects
I take my pen and pad for the weekend
Hittin' L's while I'm sleepin'
A two-day stay, you may say I need the time alone
To relax my dome, no phone, left the 9 at home
You see the streets had me stressed somethin' terrible
Fuckin' with the corners have a nigga up in Bellevue
Or HDM, hit with numbers from 8 to 10
A future in a maximum state pen is grim
So I comes back home, nobody's out but Shorty Doo-Wop
Rollin' two phillies together: in the Bridge we call'em oo-wops
He said: 
Nas, niggas caught me bustin' off the roof
So I wear a bulletproof and pack a black tre-deuce.
He inhaled so deep, shut his eyes like he was sleep
Started coughin', one eye peeked to watch me speak
I sat back like The Mack, my army suit was black
We was chillin' on these benches
Where he pumped his loose cracks
I took the L when he passed it, this little bastard
Keeps me blasted and starts talkin' mad shit
I had to school him, told him don't let niggas fool him
‘Cause when the pistol blows
The one that's murdered be the cool one
Tough luck when niggas are struck, families fucked up
Coulda caught your man, but didn't look when you bucked up
Mistakes happen, so take heed, never bust up
At the crowd, catch him solo, make the right man bleed
Shorty's laugh was cold-blooded as he spoke so foul
Only twelve, tryin' to tell me that he liked my style
Then I rose, wipin' the blunt's ash from my clothes
Then froze, only to blow the herb smoke through my nose
And told my little man I'ma ghost, I broze
Left some jewels in his skull that he can sell if he chose
Words of wisdom from Nas: try to rise up above
Keep an eye out for Jake, Shorty Wop, one love
One love, one love, one love, one love
One love, one love, one love, one love
One love, one love, one love, one love
One love, one love, one love, one love
To all my niggas locked up
From Queensbridge and all over
To my man , one love
To my man , one love
To my man , one love
Can't forget my motherfuckin' heart, Big , one love
To , yeah, one love
One time for your mind, one time
Yeah, whatever
One time for your mind, one time
Yo, whatever
One time for your mind, one time
Hey yo, Nas? Kick that fuckin' rhyme! 
Check it out, when I'm chilling, I grab the buddha
Get my crew to buy beers
And watch a flick, illin' and root for the villain, huh
Plus every morning, I go out and love it sort of chilly
Then I send a shorty from my block to the store for Phillies
After being blessed by the herb's essence
I'm back to my rest, ten minutes, some odd seconds
That's where I got the honey at, spends the night for sexin'
Keep lubrication, Lifestyle protection
Hitting up my stereo's remote control quickly
Ron G's in the cassette deck, rocking the shit, G
I try to stay mellow, rock, well a cappella rhymes'll
Make me richer than a slipper made Cinderella, fella
Go get your crew, Hobbes, I'm prepared to bomb troops
Y'all niggas was born, I shot my way out my mom dukes
When I was ten I was a hip-hoppin' shorty wop
Known for rocking microphones and twisting off a 40 top
One time for your mind, one time
Yeah, whatever
One time for your mind, one time
It sounds clever
Hey yo, Nas? Fuck that, man, that shit is phat
But kick that for them gangstas; fuck all that! 
Right, right
What up, niggas, how y'all? I's Nasty, the villain
I'm still writing rhymes, but besides that I'm chillin'
I'm tryin' to get this money, God
You know the hard times, kid
Shit, cold, be starving make you wanna do crimes kid
But I'ma lamp, ‘cause a crime couldn't beat a rhyme
Niggas catching 3 to 9's, Muslims yelling 
Free the mind
And I'm from Queensbridge, been to many places
As a kid when I would say that out of town, niggas chased us
But now I know the time, got a older mind
Plus control a 9, fine, see now I represent mine
I'm new on the rap scene, brothers never heard of me
Yet I'm a menace, yo, police wanna murder me
Heini Dark drinker, represent the thinker
My pen rides the paper, it even has blinkers
Think I'll dim the lights, then inhale, it stimulates
Floating like I'm on the North 95 Interstate
Never plan to stop, when I write my hand is hot
And expand a lot from the Wiz to Camelot
The parlayer, I'll make your heads bop, pa
I shine a light on perpetrators, like a cop's car
From day to night, I play the mic and you'll thank God
I wreck shit so much, the microphone'll need a paint job
My brain is incarcerated
Live at any jam, I couldn't count all the parks I've raided
I hold a MAC-11, and attack a reverend
I contact eleven L's and max in heaven
One time for your mind, one time
It sounds clever
One time for your mind, one time
Yeah, whatever
One time for your mind, one time
Yo, from'92 to'99
Yeah, that shit was crazy fat, pa
Know what I’m sayin'? 
But check it, you got another verse for me
I want you to kick it, you know what I'm sayin'? 
Kick that shit for the projects
Represent, represent
Represent, represent
Represent, represent
Represent, represent
Straight up, shit is real
And any day could be your last in the jungle
Get murdered on a humble, guns'll blast, niggas tumble
The corners is the hot spot, full of mad criminals
Who don't care, guzzling beers, we all stare
At the out-of-towners, they better break North
Before we get the four pounders and take their face off
The streets is filled with undercovers
Homicide chasing brothers
The D's on the roof tryin' to watch us and knock us
And killer coppers even come through in helicopters
I drink a little vodka, spark a L and hold a Glock
For the fronters, wannabe ill niggas and spot runners
Thinking it can't happen'til I trap'em and clap'em
And leave'em done, won't even run about gods
I don't believe in none of that shit, your facts are backwards
Nas is a rebel of the street corner
Pulling a TEC out the dresser; police got me under pressure
Represent, represent
Represent, represent
Represent, represent
Represent, represent
Yo, they call me Nas, I'm not your legal type of fella
Moet drinking, marijuana smoking street dweller
Who's always on the corner, rolling up blessed
When I dress, it's never nothing less than Guess
Cold be walking with a bop and my hat turned back
Love committing sins and my friends sell crack
This nigga raps with a razor, keep it under my tongue
The school drop-out, never liked the shit from day one
‘Cause life ain't shit but stress, fake niggas, and crab stunts
So I guzzle my Hennessy while pulling on mad blunts
The brutalizer, Brutus-izer, accelerator
The type of nigga who be pissing in your elevator
Somehow the rap game reminds me of the crack game
Used to sport Bally's and Cazals with black frames
Now I'm into fat chains, sex and TEC's
Fly new chicks and new kicks, Heine's and Beck's
Represent, represent
Represent, represent
Represent, represent
No doubt, see my stacks are fat, this is what it's about
Before the BDP conflict with MC Shan
Around the time when Shante dissed the Real Roxxane
I used to wake up every morning, see my crew on the block
Every day's a different plan that had us running from cops
If it wasn't hanging out in front of cocaine spots
We was at the candy factory, breaking the locks
Nowadays, I need the green in a flash just like the next man
Fuck a yard, God, let me see a hundred grand
Could use a gun, son, but fuck being the wanted man
But if I hit rock bottom then I'ma be the Son of Sam
Then call the crew to get live too, with Swoop
Bokeem, my brother Jungle, Big Bo cooks up the blow
Mike'll chop it; Mayo, you count the profit
My shit is on the streets, this way the Jakes'll never stop it
I's your brain on drugs, to all fly bitches and thugs
'Nuff respect to the projects, I'm ghost, one love
Represent y'all, represent
Represent y'all, represent
Represent y'all, represent
Represent y'all, represent
One time for your mothafuckin' mind
This goes out to everybody in New York
That's living the real fucking life and every projects, all over
To my man Big Will, he's still here
The 40 side of Vernon, my man Big L.E.S
Big Cee-Lo from the Don, Shawn Penn, the 40 busters
My crew the shorty busters, the 41st side of Vernon posse
The Goodfellas, my man Cormega, Lakey the Kid
Can't forget Draws, the Hillbillies
My man Slate, Wallethead, Black Jay, Big Oogi
Crazy barrio spot, , we rock shit a lot, Ph.D
And my man Primo, from Gang Starr
'94 real shit y'all 
Fuck y'all crab-ass niggas though! 
Bitch ass niggas! Bitch ass niggas! 
Young bitch ass motherfuckers! 
Come to Queensbridge, motherfucker! 
Yeah, yeah, let's bring it back
That's just a warm up
‘Cause I can– on anybody, anybody
It ain't hard to tell, I excel, then prevail
The mic is contacted, I attract clientele
My mic check is life or death, breathin' a sniper's breath
I exhale the yellow smoke of buddha through righteous steps
Deep like The Shining, sparkle like a diamond
Sneak a Uzi on the island in my army jacket linin'
Hit the Earth like a comet—invasion! 
Nas is like the Afrocentric Asian: half-man, half-amazin'
‘Cause in my physical I can express through song
Delete stress like Motrin, then extend strong
I drink Moët with Medusa, give her shotguns in Hell
From the spliff that I lift and inhale; it ain't hard to tell
The buddha monk's in your trunk, turn the bass up
Not stories by Aesop
Place your loot up, parties I shoot up
Nas, I analyze, drop a jew-el, inhale from the L
School a fool well, you feel it like Braille
It ain't hard to tell, I kick a skill, like Shaquille holds a pill
Vocabulary spills, I'm Ill plus Matic
I freak beats, slam it, like Iron Sheik
Jam like a TEC with correct techniques
So analyze me, surprise me, but can't magmatize me
Scannin' while you're plannin' ways to sabotage me
I leave'em froze, like heroin in your nose
Nas will rock well; it ain't hard to tell
This rhythmatic explosion
Is what your frame of mind has chosen
I'll leave your brain stimulated, niggas is frozen
Speak with criminal slang, begin like a violin
End like Leviathan, it's deep; well, let me try again
Wisdom be leakin' out my grapefruit, troop
I dominate break loops, givin' mics men-e-strual cycles
Street's disciple, I rock beats that's mega trifle
And groove even smoother than moves by Villanova
You're still a soldier, I'm like Sly Stone in Cobra
Packin' like a Rasta in the weed spot
Vocals will squeeze Glocks
MCs eavesdrop, though they need not to sneak
My poetry's deep, I never fell
Nas' raps should be locked in a cell; it ain't hard to tell
Hey Nas, hey hey boy, you see what they done did to Jimmy and Lee? 
Mmmhmm. Damn, man
I can't take it man
Sho' can't
You think this is gonna eva' change? 
Man, damn this place, man! Damn these chains! These damn chitlins every damn night
This cotton
Shit! 
I can't take it man
Harriett done left the night befo'. I's time we go
Ain't no place for black folk here. Man, promise land callin' me man
I's callin' me too
I's time we go
Yeah, I'm wichou! 
Hey man, hey damn these chains, man. Damn you master, you ain't my master, man! 
You ain't nothin', you ain't nothin'
Hey Bandit, Bandit, get the dogs! Get the hounds, we gonna
Have ourselves a hangin' tonight! 
1996! 
Back up in this nigga
The right way, though, you know? 
Double-tre son, you know ain't nothin'
Coincedental or accidental, son
No doubt! 
You know how it's goin' down, man
It was all written
No question, I'm sayin' man, I mean, how we playin' man
You know what I'm sayin', they dealt us in, son
They playin' with a 54 deck, you see with the jokers in and everything, you know what I'm saying? 
Son, I'm playin' with the 52
You wanna stress on how I used to play, that's how I play
But, yo, they takin' us into this next millenium, right now
I'm sayin' law, you know what I'm sayin' we gotta lay the law
Cause without law ain't no order, you know what I'm sayin'
That's why these cats are slippin' through, you know what I'm sayin? They got the rules missin' though
True
Yo, word up, though, you know what I mean? 
Son, these niggas look faker than the new hundred dollars, son
Yeah, you see that they look Monopoly money, right? 
Word, with the big ass face on it
Yo, what I'm sayin', we see through all that, though
You know what I'm sayin? 
No question
All eyes seein', son, you know we real
Yo, no doubt. In the Qu'ran it says Nas, the men
Nesa's the woman, you know? It was written
Fake thug, no love, you get the slug CB4 Gusto
Your luck low, I didn't know'til I was drunk though
You freak niggas played out, get fucked and ate out
Prostitute turned bitch, I got the gauge out
Ninety-six ways I made out, Montana way
The Good-F-E-L-L-A, verbal AK spray
Dipped attache, jump out the Range, empty out the ashtray
A glass of'ze, makin' mad Cassius Clay
Red dot plots, murder schemes, thirty-two shotguns
Regulate with my Dunns
Seventeen rocks gleam from one ring
They let me let y'all niggas know one thing
There's one life, one love, so there can only be one King
The highlights of livin', Vegas-style roll dice in linen
Antera spinnin' on Millenniums
Twenty G bets, I'm winnin''em; threats I'm sendin''em
Lex with TV sets the minimum
Ill sex adrenaline, party with villains
A case of Demi-Sec to chase the Henny
Wet any clique, with the semi TEC—who want it? 
Diamonds, I flaunt it, chickenheads flock, I lace'em
Fried broiled with basil, taste'em
Crack the legs way out of formation
I's horizontal how I have'em fuckin' me in the Benz wagon
Can it be Vanity from Last Dragon? 
Grab your gun, it's on though
Shit is grimy, real niggas buck in broad daylight
With the broke MAC that won't spray right
Don't give a fuck who they hit as long as the drama's lit
Yo, overnight thugs bug ‘cause they ain't promised shit
Hungry-ass hooligans stay on that piranha shit
I never sleep, ‘cause sleep is the cousin of death
I ain't the type of brother made for you to start testin'
I never sleep, ‘cause sleep is the cousin of death
I ain't the type of brother made for you to start testin'
I never sleep, ‘cause sleep is the cousin of death
I ain't the type of brother made for you to start testin'
I never sleep, ‘cause sleep is the cousin of death
I ain't the type of brother made for you to start testin'
I peeped you frontin', I was in the Jeep sunk in the seat
Tinted with heat, beats bumpin'
Across the street you was wildin'
Talkin' about how you ran the Island in'89
Layin' up, playin' the yard with crazy shine
I cocked the baby 9, that nigga gravy mine
Clanked him; what was he thinkin'
On my corner when it's pay-me time? 
Dug'em, you owe me, cousin
Somethin' told me 
Plug him! 
So dumb, felt my leg burn, then it got numb
Spun around and shot one
Heard shots and dropped, son, caught a hot one
Somebody take this biscuit'fore the cops come
Then they came askin' me my name
What the fuck? I got stitched up and went through
Left the hospital that same night, what
Got my gat back, time to backtrack
I had the drop, so how the fuck I get clapped? 
Black was in the Jeep, watchin' all these scenes speed by
It was a brown Datsun
And yo, nobody in my hood got one
That clown nigga's through, blazin' at his crew daily
The Bridge touched me up severely, hear me? 
So when I rhyme it's sincerely yours
Be lightin' L's, sippin' Coors on all floors in project halls
Contemplatin' war niggas I was cool with before
We used to score together, Uptown coppin' the raw
But a thug changes and love changes
And best friends become strangers, word up
Y'all know my steelo
There ain't an army that could strike back
There ain't an army that could strike back
There ain't an army that could strike back
There ain't an army that could strike back
Thug niggas, yo, to them thug niggas
Gettin' it on in the world, you know? 
To them niggas that's locked down
Doin' they thing, survivin', yaknowmsayin'? 
To my thorough niggas, New York and worldwide
Yo, to the Queensbridge Militia
9-6 shit, The Firm clique
Illmatic, nigga, It Was Written though
I's been a long time comin'
Y'all fake niggas, tryin' to copy
Better come with the real though, fake-ass niggas, yo
Bring the shit, man! Live, man! 
 9-6 shit
 Street dreams are made of these
Niggas push Beamers and 300 E's
A drug dealer's destiny is reaching a key
Everybody's looking for something
Street dreams are made of these
Shorties on they knees, for niggas with big cheese
Who am I to disagree? 
Everybody's looking for something
My man put me up for the share, one-fourth of a square
Headed for Delaware with one change of gear
Nothing on my mind but the dime sack we blazed
With the glaze in my eye, that we find when we crave
Dollars and cents, a fugitive with two attempts
Jakes had no trace of the face, now they drew a print
Though I'm innocent til proven guilty
I'mma try to get filthy, purchase a club and start up a realty
For real G, I'mma fullfill my dream
If I conceal my scheme then precisely I'll build my cream
The first trip without the clique
Sent the bitch with the quarter brick this is it
Fresh face, NY plates got a crooked eye for the Jakes
I want it all, Armor
All Benz and endless papes
God sake, what a nigga got to do to make a half million
Without the FBI catching feelings
Street dreams are made of these
Niggas push Beamers and 300 E's
A drug dealer's destiny is reaching a key
Everybody's looking for something
Street dreams are made of these
Shorties on they knees, for niggas with big cheese
Who am I to disagree? 
Everybody's looking for something
From Fat Cat to Pappy, niggas see the cat
Twenty-five to flat, push a thousand feet back
Holding gats wasn't making me fat, snitches on my back
Living with Moms, getting it on, flushing crack down the toilet
Two sips from being alcoholic
Nine hundred ninety nine thou from being rich but now I'm all for it
My man saw it like Dionne Warwick
A wiser team, for a wiser dream we could all score with
The cartel Argentina coke with the nina
Up in the hotel, smoking on Sessamina
Trina got the fishscale between her
The way the bitch shook her ass yo the dogs never seen her
She got me back living sweeter, fresh Caesar
Guess, David Robinson's, Wally moccasins
Bitches blow me while hopping in the drop-top BM
Word is bond son, I had that bitch down on my shit like this
Street dreams are made of these
Niggas push Beamers and 300 E's
A drug dealer's destiny is reaching a key
Everybody's looking for something
Street dreams are made of these
Shorties on they knees, for niggas with big cheese
Who am I to disagree? 
Everybody's looking for something
Growing up project-struck, looking for luck, dreaming
Scoping the large niggas beaming, check what I'm seeing
Cars, ghetto stars pushing ill Europeans
G'n, heard about them old timers OD'n
Young early 80's, throwing rocks at the crazy lady
Worshipping every word them rope-rocking niggas gave me
The street raised me up giving a fuck
I thought Jordan's and a gold chain was living it up
I knew the dopes, the pushers, the addicts, everybody
Cut out of class, just to smoke blunts and drink noddy
Ain't that funny, getting put on to crack money
With all the gunplay, painting the kettle black hungry
A case of beers in the staircase I wasted years
Some niggas went for theirs, flipping coke as they career
But I'm a rebel stressing, to pull out of the heat no doubt
With Jeeps tinted out, spending never holding out
Street dreams are made of these
Niggas push Beamers and 300 E's
A drug dealer's destiny is reaching a key
Everybody's looking for something
Street dreams are made of these
Shorties on they knees, for niggas with big cheese
Who am I to disagree? 
Everybody's looking for something
Street dreams are made of these
Niggas push Beamers and 300 E's
A drug dealer's destiny is reaching a key
Everybody's looking for something
Street dreams are made of these
Shorties on they knees, for niggas with big cheese
Who am I to disagree? 
Everybody's looking for something
Damn
Look how muh-fuckers use a nigga
Just use me for whatever the fuck they want
I don't get to say shit
Just grab me, just do what the fuck they want
Sell me, throw me away
Niggas just don't give a fuck about a nigga like me, right
Like I'm a f-, I'm a gun, shit
I's like I'm a motherfucking gun
I can't believe this shit
Word up, word up
I seen some cold nights and bloody days
They grab me and bullets spray
They use me wrong so I sing this song'til this day
My body is cold steel for real
I was made to kill, that's why they keep me concealed
Under car seats they sneak me in clubs
Been in the hands of mad thugs
They feed me when they load me with mad slugs
Seventeen precisely, one in my head
They call me Desert Eagle, semi-auto with lead
I'm seven inches four pounds, been through so many towns
Ohio to Little Rock to Canarsie, living harshly
Beat up and battered they pull me out
I watch as niggas scattered, making me kill
But what I feel it never mattered
When I'm empty I'm quiet, finding myself fiending to be fired
A broken safety, niggas place me in shelves
Under beds so I beg for my next owner to be a thoroughbred
Keep me full up with hollow heads
How you like me now? I go blaow
I's that shit that moves crowds making every ghetto foul
I might have took your first child
Scarred your life, or crippled your style
I gave you power, I made you buck-wild
How you like me now? I go blaow
I's that shit that moves crowds making every ghetto foul
I might have took your first child
Scarred your life, or crippled your style
I gave you power, I made you buck-wild
Always I'm in some shit
My abdomen is the clip, the barrel is my dick uncircumcised
Pull my skin back and cock me
I bust off when they unlock me
Results of what happens to niggas shock me
I see niggas bleeding running from me in fear, stunningly tears
Fall down the eyes of these so-called tough guys, for years
I've been used in robberies, giving niggas heart to follow me
Placing peoples in graves, funerals made cause I was sprayed
I was laid in a shelf, with a grenade
Met a wrecked-up Tec with numbers on his chest that say
Five-two-oh-nine-three-eight-five and zero
Had a serial defaced, hoping one day police would place
Where he came from, a name or some sort of person to claim him
Tired of murdering, made him wanna be a plain gun
But yo, I had some other plans like the next time the beef is on
I make myself jam right in my owner's hand
How you like me now? I go blaow
I's that shit that moves crowds making every ghetto foul
I might have took your first child
Scarred your life, or crippled your style
I gave you power, I made you buck-wild
How you like me now? I go blaow
I's that shit that moves crowds making every ghetto foul
I might have took your first child
Scarred your life, or crippled your style
I gave you power, I made you buck-wild
Yo, weeks went by and I'm surprised
Still stuck in the shelf with all the things that an outlaw hides
Besides me it's bullets, two vests and then a nine
There's a grenade in a box, and that Tec that kept crying
Cause he ain't been cleaned in a year he's rusty, it's clear
He's bout to fall to pieces cause of his murder career
Yo I can hear somebody coming in, open the shelf
His eyes bubbling, he said it was on
I felt his palm troubled him shaking
Somebody stomped him out, his dome was aching
He placed me on his waist, the moment I've been waiting
My creation was for Blacks to kill Blacks
I's gats like me that accidentally go off, making niggas memories
But this time, it's done intentionally
He walked me outside, saw this cat
Cocked me back, said, 
Remember me? 
He pulled the trigger but I held on, it felt wrong
Knowing niggas is waiting in hell for him
He squeezed harder, I didn't budge, sick of the blood
Sick of the thugs, sick of wrath of the next man's grudge
What the other kid did was pull out, no doubt
A newer me in better shape, before he lit out, he lead the chase
My owner fell to the floor his wig split so fast
I didn't know he was hit, it's over with
Heard mad niggas screaming, niggas running, cops is coming
Now I'm happy, until I felt somebody else grab me
Damn
They never realized how real Nas is so decisive
I's just the likeness of Israelites mist that made me write this
A slight twist of lime rhyme, be chasing down your primetime
Food for thought or rather mind wine
The Don Juan features the freak shit, my thesis
On how we creep quick, fucking your wife that ain't so secret
I's mandatory, see that pussy, they hand it to me
I got no game it's just some bitches understand my story
There ain't no drama that my niggas never handle for me
My gator brand is Mauri, walking through rough land before me
Where the snakes put a smile on they face
Hoping and praying I'm stuck
Scoping they lay in the cut, weighing my luck
Player haters play this in cell blocks and rock stages
Winking at some females cops with cocked gauges
Really it's papers I'm addicted to
Wasn't for rap then I'll be sticking you
The Mac inside the Triple Goose
Facedown on the floor's the routine
Don't want hear nobody blow steam
Just cream or it's a smoke screen
Imagine that, that's why I hardly kick the bragging raps
I zone, to each his own and this ghetto inhabitant
Gotta watch dem niggas that be close to you
And make sure they do what they supposed to do
Cause you know they be thinking about smoking you
Never personal, nowadays, it's the ways
Watch dem niggas that be close to you
And make sure they do what they supposed to do
Cause you know they be thinking about smoking you
Never personal, nowadays, it's the ways
Now how can I perfect this? 
Living reckless, die for my necklace
Crime infected, driving a Lexus with a death wish
Jetting, checking my message on the speaker
Bopping to 
Mona Lisa, brown reefer, ten G's, gun and my Visa
CD cranking, doing 90 on the Franklin D. Roosevelt
No seatbelt, drinking and thinking
My man caught a bad one son, niggas is frightened
Secret indictments, as on to one seeking enlightment
My Movado says seven, the God hour that's if you follow
Traditions started by the school not far from the Apollo
My'fuck tomorrow' motto through the eyes of Pablo
Escobar, the desperado, word to Cus D'Amato
Gotta watch dem niggas that be close to you
And make sure they do what they supposed to do
Cause you know they be thinking about smoking you
Never personal, nowadays, it's the ways
Watch dem niggas that be close to you
And make sure they do what they supposed to do
Cause you know they be thinking about smoking you
Never personal, nowadays, it's the ways
Some niggas watch you
See you when you think you on the low
Ain't hard to spot you, you swore to keep it real after you blow
Three keys, new V's, went to Anguilla with your ho
Stayed around the hood, smoothest cat getting the dough
Them oldtimers advise you to them problems that's ahead
Drama with the Feds, not listening just bobbing your head
Your Roley shining, thinking to yourself'nobody's taking mine'
At the same time your ho is getting snatched from behind
Put in a van, where's the hundred grand, strippin' her hand
From all the ice, wouldn't you know
You knew these niggas all your life
What made them mark you victim
You fucked up somewhere down the line
Now they had to target your Wisdom
She took'em to your place, straight to your safe
You doubted it could happen, sick of yapping
Jump in your ride, headed to your side
Puffin' ganja, get to your crib, can't find her
Just a reminder: shouldn't have your stash house where you crash out
Could have passed out, your coke was gone, now you assed out
Dead bitches tell no lies, you should use your eyes
Gotta watch dem niggas that be close to you
And make sure they do what they supposed to do
Cause you know they be thinking about smoking you
Never personal, nowadays, it's the ways
Watch dem niggas that be close to you
And make sure they do what they supposed to do
Cause you know they be thinking about smoking you
Never personal, nowadays, it's the ways
I made it like that, I bought it like that, I'm living like that
I made it like that, I bought it like that, I'm living like that
Yeah
I never brag how real I keep it, cause it's the best secret
I rock a vest prestigious, Cuban link flooded Jesus
In a Lex watching Kathie Lee and Regis
My actions are one with the seasons
A TEC squeezing executioner
Wintertime I rock a fur
Mega popular center of attraction
Climaxing, my bitches, they be laughing
They high from sniffing coke off a twenty-cent Andrew Jackson
City lights spark a New York night
Rossi and Martini sipping, Sergio Tacchini
Flipping mad pies, low price
I blow dice and throw them
.45 by my scrotum, manifest the Do or Die slogan
My niggas roll in ten M3's
Twenty Gods popping wheelies on Kawasakis
Hip hop's got me on some ol', spraying shots like a drum roll
Blanking out and never miscount the shells my gun hold
I don't stunt, I regulate
Henny and Sprite, I separate, watching crab niggas marinate
I'm all about TECs, a good jux and sex
Israelite books, holding government names from Ness
MC's are crawling out every hole in the slum
You be aight like blood money in a pimp's cum
I made it like that, I bought it like that, I'm living like that
I made it like that, I bought it like that, I'm living like that
For you wack MC's
Currency has made in trust of the Messiah
I'm spending it to get higher
Earth, Wind and Fire singing reasons why I'm
Up early, trustworthy is a nine that bust early
Sunshine on my grill, I spill Remy on imaginary graves
Put my hat on my waves, latter Day Saints say religious praise
I dolo, challenge any team or solo
You must be bugging out, new to my shit, home on a furlough
Ask around who's laid up, sharp and straight up
Mafioso, getting niggas' wakes sprayed up
Skies are misty, my life's predicted by a gypsy
I'll one day walk into shots, drunk off champagne from Sicily
This be the drama, I'mma pause like a comma
In a sentence, paragraph's indented
Bloodshot red eyes high, yellow envelopes of lye
Opening cigars let tobacco fly
Condos are tune-proof, we're looking out the sky's moonroof
Shitting like gin and prune juice
Yo the system wants the coon's noose, hang'em high
Courtrooms filled up, it's off the hook while I
Just wrote a statement, like I'm facing twenty years
In the basement, chilling on the VI with Mumia
For wearing chrome, I told the judge snakes slither
Like Sharon Stone but like Capone I'm thrown, yo
I made it like that, I bought it like that, I'm living like that
I made it like that, I bought it like that, I'm living like that
For you wack MC's
I made it like that, I bought it like that, I'm living like that
I made it like that, I bought it like that, I'm living like that
For you wack MC's
Yo the time is wasting, I use the mind elevation
Dime sack lacing, court pen pacing
Individual, lyrical math abrasion
Psychic evaluation, the foulest nation
We living in dangerous lives, mad leak and battered wives
A lifestyle on bad streets is patternized
Wise men build and destroy
While the real Mc
Coy dope fiend named Detroit is still dealing boy
Coke suppliers acting biased
Cause rumors say that nigga's wear wires and we liars
But every night the gat's fired and every day a rat's hired
I still remain the mack flyest in the phat Kani's
Just a killer in me, slash drug dealer MC
Ex-slug filler, semi mug peeler
Demi, bottles of Mo', yo simply follow me flow
Put poetry inside a crack pot and blow
Rough hoes pull crack out pussies and buttholes
Bring the G's and the D's roll, they can't touch those
Why shoot the breeze about it when you could be about it
My degrees are routed, toward the peasy haired brick houses
Instead of the fake medallions
Rich niggas transport in thousands
Foreign cash exchange amounting to millions
Doors is locked, rocks is chopped, watch the cameras in the ceilings
Trick bitches catching mad feelings
Peeling off in the Lex Jeep, techniques is four-wheeling
I bet it be some shit when we connect with Stretch
When we catch them sex niggas with the tecs you blessed word
So now it's on, never wasted a slug
Time is money when it comes to mine, take it in blood
I made it like that, I bought it like that, I'm living like that
I made it like that, I bought it like that, I'm living like that
For you wack MC's
I made it like that, I bought it like that, I'm living like that
I made it like that, I bought it like that, I'm living like that
For you wack MC's
Yea, Capone-n-Noreaga
Yeah yo offical Queensbridge murderers

Niggas stealin beats and niggas is stealin' your whole techniques and shit, niggas wanna take everything from a nigga man
 Yeah yeah yo Nas it's like this man
Niggas can't do it like I do it, d'yaknahmsayin'
Just like niggas can't do what you do
 Right, right
 You know, can't nobody fuck with this
You know all these niggas out here just
Talkin' this East coast West coast bullshit
Niggas need to kill that shit
And make some money, y'know
 Word
 Fuck it
 What is it, what is it God
 Let's get together, make some fuckin' music
 Right, that's what I'm sayin', that's what I'm sayin'
 and get paid, and just, let that be it
All these niggas talkin all this bullshit
Better sit back, and watch what happens
The Golden Child chop that ass up, you was holding out
Let the streets be the court and corners hold the trial
Fatal not fictitious
I rock the cable 86 shit
Foreign cars young with crazy bitches
Mad smoke makes me able to quote
Soliciting ill editions of that Murder I Wrote
A provocative plan can bring a knot to my hand
As the pyramids that stand on top of the sand
In the heat of the moment, like Farrakhan said we need atonement
Bulletproof glass, S-classes chrome kitted up
Calicones lit it up
I didn't get touched checking my nuts
I stood up and lit a Dutch
Clutching gats quick to bust
But knowing how these niggas tattle
I sneak move get the drop, one shot without the gun battle
So when you run the lead travel
I come through it's taboo
Ninety-six ways made to clap you
Nas is coming
Nas is coming
Nas is coming
Nasty Nas is coming
Nas is coming

Nas is coming
Nas is coming
Nasty Nas is coming
Nas is comin
In the black limo, Jack Daniels through the cracked window
I spot the fake, red dot his face like a Hindu
Snatched the symbol, tied his hands to make examples
Substantial amounts you owe to the firm
Crew, Firm affliation, paper chasing
Chips glossy, rich Pablo Escabano
Sophisticado, blazing hollows like Saddles
Rap apostle, nacho cheese, I'm Castro
Compared to these niggas who swear to be real
But impostors to Hoffa
Nas plague kills
Counting bills to send to all my jail niggas who fell
From New York to LA, QB to CPT for GP
A hundred G cars
Garcia Vegas cigars
Kani shit, mad jiggy
The clout, murder material serial scratched out
My name's passed out like it's something venereal
But back in stereo
Nas is coming
Nas is coming
Nas is coming
Nasty Nas is coming
Nas is coming

Nasty Nas is coming

From childbirth to hearses, flow like the Nile cover surface
I bit the fruit from the Serpent
Apocalyptic, get bent stay splifted
Control the rap game you got it twisted
Dr. Dre way the Bridge say, shake dice and kiss it
Sip Crist' push the six with biscuit
Jeep full of chickens, pull up beside, have a listen y'all Nas y'all
Fly gangsta wavy hair teeth chipped in
My shit bump in the courtroom drunk, links truck
Rocky bracelet cognac kernel never chase it
Rap hero black De
Niro
Federal Bureau tapped my line and got zero
Rap pro diamond roll, hustling low
Pro-file white gold style, raking bloody dough by the pile
Shot down still alive he struggling for the phone
Fo-fo blow him, when homicide comes, these three words are sung
Nas is coming
Nas is coming
Nas is coming
Nasty Nas is coming
Nas is coming
Nas is coming
Nas is coming

Nasty Nas is coming

Check this out, it's Nasty Nas, and Dr. Dre
East meets West
That's how we making it happen
That's how it goes down for the nine-six
Aiyyo Nas let's get this money
Let's get paid
Sit back and watch all these motherfucking clowns out here
Riffing and beefing about this bullshit
Yo while they doing all that
We just gon' kick back with these honeys
This Cristal and party to the year 2G
Nas is coming
Nas is coming

Nasty Nas is coming

This is what, this what they want, huh? 
This is what it's all about? 
Time to take Affirmative Action, son
They just don't understand, you kna'mean? 
Niggas comin' sideways, thinkin' stuff is sweet, man
Niggas don't understand the four devils
Lust, envy, hate, jealousy—wicked niggas, man
Yo, sit back, relax, catch your contact
Sip your con-gi-ac
And let's all wash this money through this laundry mat
Sneak attack the new cats in rap, worth top dollar
In fact, touch mines and I'll react like a Rottweiler
Who could relate? We play for high stakes at gunpoint
Catch'em and break, undress'em
Tie'em with tape, no escape
The Corleone, fettuccine Capone
Roam in your own zone
Or get kidnapped and clapped in your dome
We got it sewn, The Firm art of war is unknown
Lower your tone, face it, homicide cases get blown
Aristocrats, politickin' daily with diplomats
See me, I'm an official mack, Lex Coupe triple black
Criminal thoughts in the blue Porsche
My destiny's to be the new boss
That nigga Paulie gotta die, he too soft
That nigga's dead on, a ki of heroin
They found his head on the couch
With his dick in his mouth; I put the hit out
Yo, the smoothest killer since Bugsy
Bitches love me, and Queens where my drugs be
I wear Guess jeans and rugbies
Yo, my people from Medina, they will see ya
When you re-up, bring your heater
All your cream go between us
Real shit, my Desert Eagle got a ill grip
I chill with niggas that hit Dominican spots and steal bricks
My red beam made a dread scream and sprayed a fed team
Corleone be turnin' niggas to fiends
Yukons and ninja black Lexus
Mega the pretty boy, with mafia connections
I's The Firm, nigga, set it
Yo, my mind is seeing through your design like Blind Fury
I shine jewelry, sippin' on crushed grapes, we lust papes
And push cakes inside the casket at Just wake
I's sickenin', he just finished bidding upstate
And now the projects is talking that somebody-gotta-die shit
I's logic as long as it's nobody that's in my clique
My man Smoke know how to expand coke in Mr. Coffee
Feds cost me two mill' to get the system off me
Life's a bitch, but God forbid the bitch divorce me
I'll be flooded with ice, so hell fire can't scorch me
Cuban cigars meeting Foxy at the Mosque
Moving cars, your top papi Señor Escobar
In the black Camaro
Firm deep, all my niggas hail the blackest sparrow
Wallabee's be the apparel
Through the darkest tunnel
I got visions of multi millions in the biggest bundle
In the Lex pushed by my nigga Jungle
E Money bags got Moet Chandon
Bundle of sixty-two
They ain't got a clue what we about to do
My whole team, we shittin' hard like Czar
Sosa, Foxy Brown, Cormega and Escobar
I keep a fat marquess piece, laced in all the illest snake skin
Armani sweaters, Carolina Herrera
Be The Firm, baby, from BK to the Bridge, my nigga Wiz
Operation Firm Biz, so what the deal is? 
I keep a phat jew-el, sippin' Crist-ies
Sittin' on top of fifty grand in the Nautica Van
We stay incogni' like all them thug niggas in Marcy
The gods, they praise Allah with visions of Gandhi
Bet it on my whole crew is Don Juan
On Cayman Island with a case of Cristal
And Baba Shallah spoke
Nigga with them Cubans that snort coke
Raw though, an ounce mixed with leak, that's pure though
Flippin' the bigger picture
The bigger nigga with the cheddar was mad dripper
He had a fuckin' villa in Manilla
We got to flee to Panama, but wait, it's half-and-half
Ki's is one and two-fifth, so how we flip? 
32 grams raw, chop it in half, get 16
Double it times three, we got 48
Which mean a whole lot of cream
Divide the profit by four
Subtract it by eight, we back to 16
Now add the other two that'Mega bringing through
So let's see, if we flip this other ki
Then that's more for me, mad coke and mad leak
Plus a five hundred cut in half is two-fifty
Now triple that times three
We got three quarters of another ki
The Firm, baby, volume one
Q.B. since 1933
To nine-six
Check the shit
Nine-six, Escobar 600
Check the shit
My mind's set, son got wet
I'm vexed really
They snatched off his Rolex, smacked his bitch silly
Why niggas acting illy word to Will he bout to feel it
I feel it, he shoulda been dealt with it
Them niggas sour they put to much flour in their coke
And got the nerve to wonder why they're broke
While we was gleaming, niggas was scheming
Seen the ill Bimmers beaming
Triple-beam and doubling cream, had em fiending
To get they fingers on the dosa
I called Sosa
Sosa, these niggas hit the God bring the toaster
Meet me in the Bridge I'm bout to go loca
Left my rat beggin me to stay and stroke her
He came through with two fly bitches, Venus and Vicious
With two macs inside the Volvo
What up God, I'm still sober
I need some Henn to bend me over
My nigga Hav gotta soldier
I's getting down, it's going down kid
I heard he might not live, I'm holding back tears
Told these broads to put it in gear
With two females that don't smile digging they style yo
Whattup son, these niggas done started something wild
You know the clique well, Rhamel with the gold in his grill
Tried to get a name holding the steel
I paid attention to the females
Maintained bitches when it get real
Sos' pulled me close and told me the deal
He said both hoes'll peel
Spray shots and reload and still handle the wheel
Point em out smoke a Phil' then chill
I layed back Escobar status, knowing The Firm got it cornered
We on it, shit we was born with
 x2
Spark the lye, QBC yo it's do or die
In this, business of trifeness
I finesse this, Boyardee, we chef shit
Perfect shit, Albert Einstein minds connect wit
Dangerous sons, step back let the TEC lift
Lift you up, bless you with a shorty then we set you up
Hold it right there pull over
That nigga right there inside the Rover
I knew he'd be right here, I told you
Let's get him now, look at him smile, ice Bulova
Polo pullover, big links and rocking boulders
He's stunting, after he left my man like that
Without a fair chance to fight back, but I'll be right back
He never seen us, 
Sos' gave the mac to Venus
And Vicious, lookin delicious, handle yo' business
And step to him, shake your ass try to screw him
Do what ya gotta do to get to him
A tight Parasuco, with young faces
Can turn niggas Buttafuoco, of all ages
They was amused by the way they walked, way they talked
Only if they knew these girls'd spray New York If they had to
Heard him ask Venus, 
Could I have you? 
He jumped out a Jeep, heard her tell him 
Don't grab boo
They started chatting, was only bout a minute, flat when
They jumped in the back of the Jeep laughing
We followed them pollying, he thought the hoes were Somalian
Probably when they hit the Holiday Inn
I grabbed the phone and called the Mobb and them
We layed low about a hour or so, these bitches movin' too slow
We both holding, what if them wild hoes started folding
Sosa, said say no more, we started rolling
Before we got in they must have shot him, security wildin'
There the girls go, hurry up we out
In the 940, me Sosa and two shorties
The punk niggas got murdered in the orgy
Spark the lye, QBC yo it's do or die
In this, business of trifeness
I finesse this, Boyardee, we chef shit
Perfect shit, Albert Einstein minds connect wit
Dangerous sons, step back let the TEC lift
Lift you up, bless you with a shorty then we set you up
QBC, Queensbridge motherfucker
Roping niggas up
Cause our clique is thick
Another day another dollar
More money, more murder
Fuck this shit, Q.B. up in the house
 HELLO? ! 
 Whassup girl
 Ain't nothin - this nigga in here stressin
Talkin that old off the wall back to Africa shit again
 What, that God Body shit? 
 Yeah, that dumb shit
I'm tryin to get up OUTTA here
 I hear that.. but yo, you know the spot is pumpin tonight
 Word f'real where? 
 You know, where the real niggas is poppin the Cristal
Not that White Star! 
 Ha hah! Word where the real niggas at? 
 Listen.. to reason
Pretty baby baby listen
A young wild beautiful love child
You like them thug style link rockin, then mink coppin
Hit you on the sink a hundred dollar drink poppin
The head'll make you take him shoppin, a foul doctrine
Reminiscent of my first time up in a chick
You was innocent, but now you rent-a-dick, wear the tightest shit
Chanel lookin real, airbrushed nails
Hit the gym, hit the scales, heaven-sent but negligent 
To see a prophecy, your ebony tone is lockin me
The way you moan make me daydream of you on top of me
Wishin I could be the one man; but you juggle
Way too many Willies all in one hand
You wanna run up in clubs, gettin rubbed on
Niggas pull your hair, shake your fat rear
Get your fuck on - followin week, you back there
But what you stuck on, weed, clowns and cars
Puffin with some lil nigga, husband not knowin she's out
Could you believe Eve, Mother Earth of the seas
Niggas thirst you, you just let em hurt you and leave
What up mah, frontin like you naive
Push your man's whip, calling police when you flip
Can't understand it, yo it should be a throne for us
But for now that's a whole different zone from us, word! 
Diamonds all shinin, lookin all fine
Pretty little face, get a little high
Young girl stugglin, tryin to survive
Mother of the Earth, she made you and I
Just tired of playin the same ol' games
Messin with my mind, emotional thangs
And there goes.. a black girl.. lost
Like Isis, she got you heartbroke and felt lifeless
Grow up girl instead you want revenge so now you act the nicest
To who'sever gettin down and trifless
To get his mind all you do is give him somethin priceless
Cause in time he'll realize the thighs is all he needs
More than weed, then you hit him off with lies and greed 
There you go again, startin wars, makin me more yours
Seem to get a kick out of keepin me on all fours
Face glistenin, I'm addicted to you
Original, Wisdom Body got me picturin you
Igloos of ice trickin on you, you never listen
To this nigga spendin Franklins on tennis anklets
Must've had a bad deal in the past though
Can't even keep it real with a nigga with cash flow
Say men are all the same, what we need to do is break this chain
You got a job part-time and school's your night thing
With dreams to settle down, it ain't far from now
You gettin interviewed, but your boss is into gettin screwed
Typical day that the black girl sees
Comin home wantin more from a college degree
Where are you focused, on legit niggas and where the coke is
Nice and Thug Life niggas, yo you seem hopeless
Your value - too much to be measured, I wonder how you
Could ever be played, your pussy worth gold amountin to
More than the world, but not knowin nothin about you
You leavin the crib, takin all your kids out to
Drop them off, lettin some nigga knock you off
So hot and soft, that's the same thing that got you lost 
Growin up seein it, it should remind you, you bein lied to
Everything that move be inside you
Sacred as you are, left with these wannabes to guide you
I watched you, hard to knock you, I tried not to
They spot you out dancin topless in your drawers
Damn look, there goes a black girl lost
You should be ashamed of yourself
The way you carry yourself
The way you hang out all night long
Doin silly things that is wrong
Black girl
It was a murder
Jake just hit the corner people swarming
Three in the morning I jumped out my cab like 
Fuck
Niggas is buck,  mega bloodshed, the tape's red
I heard some bird whisper, 
Yo he should have ducked
I puffed the lila, just before I hit the scene for rilla, I'm all high
I's late I'm looking down at the fella
Shit's pushed in, ambulance placed him on some cushion
His mom's had a stare I wouldn't dare second look when I murk
It hurt, kind of took it as a brief reminder
That the street's designed to stop your life clock
The beast'll time ya, cell to cell, suspect ass nigga you fail
First time locked in Comstock, my mind blocks the frail
Bursting, blasting at your forty cal shell, split your dry cell
My niggas never snitch why tell
We roll with no regrets, destinies, fiftys and equities
Queens'll be the death of me
 x2
To the suspect witness: don't come outside
You might get your shit pushed back tonight
Dear God, I want the riches, money hungry bitches infested
Giving the jealous niggas sickness to witness
My crew dresses in vests, feel the essence
Try to test this scientist, able and reckless slaughter
Nautica Down, frames look petite
Ten millis, minks designed just for my physique
I keep a low pro as if I owe, bless the flow lovely
My pants hang while I'm dancing, sipping the bubbly
Hey, me no worry, hashish keep my eyes Chinese
Roll the two Phillies together, make blunts Siamese
I meant it, I represent it, descendant made of
Early natives that were captured and taught to think backwards
Trapped us in a cracker's psychiatric, it's massive
A Million Man March, alert the masses
Tan Clarks, Armani in small print upon my glasses
Don assassins, Armageddon
The wedding of a freak and a beast
Seven heads, got the righteous threatened
Life Was Written, the plot curves behind the settin'
Comprehend the grammar, Math we own
Are you the type of nigga to shoot a leg to get your name known? 
I flip the brain tone
Niggas get hit and wrapped in plastic
The mic I strike in vain, givin' the pain of what a MAC is
What you with? Luchi or drama
No sleep means insomnia
No need to check the clock, the streets'll time ya
To the suspect witness: don't come outside
You might get your shit pushed back tonight
It justifies Nas Escobar's leavin' shit mesmerized
Mega live, like the third world
Decipher my deceiver make him a believer
Spitting gem stars, words in my mic type receiver
Bond is my life so I live by my word
Never fraudulent Queensbridge don't make no herbs
Spread my name to deacons, politicians while they speakin'
Rebel to America civilization
Caught you sleepin'
Street educated, created
Fly gangsta, Firm style
AZ, what up, what up? 
Jungle, Benny Blanco from the Bridge
Mega, big Hi, clap em down
L.E.S. on a murder quest
Yo, release what's in me
Besides the Henny, it's eyes that's seen plenty
Fiends get skinny as if Queens was a Craig Jenny
Instead of diet plans it's crack 200 grams
I pump a G-pack, peeping for where the D's at
I's slow, lookin' for Rambo, the cop who got grazed
Back in the days, chasin' niggas through my project maze
That cop he got a death wish
He run behind niggas until you breathless
Everyday he makin' ten arrests, shit! 
My nigga check this, I know the bitch he rest with
I even blessed it, forty-dash-ten inspect it
Peep, he parked his Jeep in the back of the slum
To check Tanisha, fat ass real fly, with the blonde caesar
Vittadini summer gear, she push the two-seater
I heard she brag about the way he eat her
A Irish man short slim with a tan, they say he laced her cheeba
She due, be lookin' weaker, now her teeth are foul
Speakin' loud, peep her style, in and out of every reefer cloud
Fat ass dissolvin', like cotton candy in a mouth that's starvin'
Rock the same gear daily, like a soldier in my squadron
I heard she let Jake investigate from her window
Cause she's a nympho, suckin' dick and coughin' up info
So now it's set up, her and the beast to get wet up
I know he vest up, we blazin' from the neck up
 Soon as he open let your Gi-Glock burst
They had the chains on, son hit the lock first
We busted in the cop jerked
Jungle popped one in his shirt
I grabbed the bitch by her tits, she tried to say she Earth
We saw the cameras, tape recorders, and the monitors
They eyein us
Pull his shades down, they seen his last days now
There's no way now, we can be treated just like a slave now
Two in the dome, he's laid down
Ayo the bitch is saved now
She's living in a snitch grave now
Shootouts is similar to Wild West
Broad daylight, face to face without a vest
You know the episodes, thugs camouflage the spectacles
Please God just save the life that the Devil sold
See It Was Written but was never told
Peep the jewels black man, it's even better than gold
Niggas roll with iron, police roll in hot pursuit
Tryin' to stop the loot, fuck Jake, cock and shoot
Still on the streets with my peeps so deep
We threw a block party for my man goin' up creek
To do his two to four
Niggas show love, from all around the board
Peace Lord
Sony Handy-Cam on record
Pop a bottle, cause when you come home we still got it sewn
We can watch the tape play back and just zone
Film all the bitches, on the benches with ill extensions
We block the streets off, only crew cars can enter
Music was loud and it was crowded
Barbecued wings we fed the fiends  Killa shouted
And Frank tried to stop the bank, lost about what a Roley cost
Guzzled his drink, and staggered off
He's a Big Will, used to slang krill, now he own The Hill
Couldn't take losin' his cash, and I could feel
Somethin' in the air yeah
Frank returned with Pierre
A gun slinger, who niggas hadn't seen in a year
I usually be holdin' -'specially this type of weekend
And everyone except for me had started reachin'
They had gats in each others faces, with kids
And grandmothers around, Frank's only concern was his paper
My man Killa let off, half of them fake niggas jet off
Police blitz quick, waitin' for that to set off
Runnin' the static, it got me mad cause they a bunch of faggots
Startin' shit in my hood, I can't have it
Yo High, get the 40-Cali stainless, Jake is still out
Let's make it real and still make them niggas famous
Dip behind trees in fatigues and squeeze, dodge and weave
Hearin' Jake retaliatin', and Wiz was up the alley waitin'
We breeze, jump in the ride, heard Pierre died
Internal bleedin' inside, and ain't been back since ninety-five
Fresh out the  motherfuckin' pack 
For niggas don't know how to act 
Fresh out the  motherfuckin' pack 
For niggas don't know how to act
Yo, NYC, U-N-I-verse, seriously
Havoc and P, Queens niggas so it seem to be
Monopolize, strategies of war, exercise
Mega got word back from Noreaga
The D.A. got video cassette tape of
The god with the God-U-Now, pullin' a caper
Runnin' up in the spot, mask and duct taped up
Pig-tied they motherfuckin' wrists to they ankles
I been through, crime shit my niggas into
Peep the issue, situation like this, we stickin him too
JFK on our way to L.A
Got links with big cats down in Santa Barbré
My crew do it the Mobb way, every day
Crime pay, who wanted gunplay? Thrill me
Niggas kill me, grillin' me, you wanna look? Peep the nine milli
Now undress, you know the drill-y
Niggas suspect, weak links pose threats
I have yet to met challenger who go against my set
Gemstars razor sharp like Gillette, shavin' closely on
Any character approach me
I let the streets get the best of me, infamy, my destiny
While cat burg-lars tryin' to sneak peep the recipe
Inside my rap cookbook, paragraphs is gourmet
You pay about $5, 000 a plate
No doubt kid, I hit them niggas like a bid
The prosecutor, runnin' up in your crib
Do your dirt, I do my dirt all by my lonely
I's only me, and the gat that's holdin' me
We got it locked beyond measure, your clique's under pressure
Extort you for your treasure, smack you with the undresser
Represent your clique, go ahead, get that ass whipped
Wannabe thug, get smacked for back talkin'
QB represent fuck that, it can happen
While you rappin', I'm busy tryin' to sneak the gat in
Contamin', cut the party short while you jammin'
We think smarter, reach harder
Got the.44, bodyguard of somethin' you don't want a part of
If I was you, then I would do what I have to
But you ain't me, you hesitated so I clapped you
Then stepped off casually, naturally me
Niggas thinkin' shit sweet
I carry big heat, wavy hair, chipped teeth
Up in this bitch deep, Queens murder cliques meet
Yellow tapes on black gates
Mediterranean, projects is like Kuwait
I escape into zones, that's irregular
Why debate on the phone, I'm solar cellular
Escobar 600
You just a crumb inside a world where the rich run it
Curriculum of a mathologist
Deep throats, they try to swallow this
Anthropologists, dynasties of great knowledgists
I preserve in my dome, niggas mics is full of silicone
Spot's blown, guerilla ice on this killer's life
I put my word on it
Now you can sleep on or rock or swerve on it
Nas is menage a trois' on Mount Airy lodges
We like a smooth fam', but rougher than El De
Barge's
Catchin charges, of marksmen, living heartless
Grab a cartridge, cock my shit on some Mob shit
We mobbing
Putting niggas in mausoleums
From Queens cross the Throgs Neck, heads bop, I see'em
For niggas don't know how to act
To all my niggas on the block slangin' crack
Rest in peace to my niggas layin' on they back
To all the niggas who bust gat
For niggas don't know how to act
To all my niggas on the block slangin' crack
Rest in peace to my niggas on they back
To all the niggas who bust gat
For niggas don't know how to act
To all the niggas on the block slangin' crack
Rest in peace to my niggas on they back
To all the niggas who bust gat
Life, I wonder
Will it take me under? 
I don't know
Imagine smoking weed in the streets without cops harassin'
Imagine going to court with no trial
Lifestyle cruising blue Bahama waters, no welfare supporters
More conscious of the way we raise our daughters
Days are shorter, nights are colder
Feeling like life is over, these snakes strike like a cobra
The world's hot my son got knocked, evidently
I's elementary, they want us all gone eventually
Trooping out of state for a plate of knowledge
If coke was cooked without the garbage
We'd all have the top dollars
Imagine everybody flashin', fashion, designer clothes
Lacing your clique up with diamond Roles
Your people holding dough, no parole, no rubbers
Go in raw, imagine law with no undercovers
Just some thoughts for the mind
I take a glimpse into time
Watch the blimp read 
The World Is Mine
If I ruled the world 
I'd free all my sons, I love'em love'em, baby
Black diamonds and pearls
If I ruled the world
The way to be, paradise like relaxin'
Black, Latino and Anglo-Saxon
Armani Exchange deranged
Cash, Lost Tribe of Shabazz, free at last
Brand new whips to crash, then we laugh in the iller path
The Villa house is for the crew, how we do
Trees for breakfast, dime sexes and Benz stretches
So many years of depression make me vision
The better livin', type of place to raise kids in
Open they eyes to the lies history's told foul
But I'm as wise as the old owl, plus the Gold Child
Seeing things like I was controllin', click rollin'
Tricking six digits on kicks and still holdin'
Trips to Paris, I civilized every savage
Give me one shot, I turn trife life to lavish
Political prisoner set free, stress free
No work release, purple M3's and jet skis
Feel the wind breeze in West Indies
I make Coretta Scott-King mayor the cities
And reverse fiends to Willies
It sounds foul, but every girl I meet'd go downtown
I'd open every cell in Attica, send'em to Africa
If I ruled the world 
I'd free all my sons, I love'em love'em, baby
Black diamonds and pearls
If I ruled the world
And then we'll walk right up to the sun
Hand in hand
We'll walk right up to the sun
We won't land
You'd love to hear the story how the thugs live in worry
Duck down in car seats, heat's mandatory
Running from Jake, getting chased, hunger for papes
These are the breaks, many mistakes go down out of state
Wait, I had to let it marinate, we carry weight
Trying to get laced, flip the ace, stack the safe
Millionaire plan to keep the gat with the cocked hammer
Making moves in Atlanta, back-and-forth scrambler
‘Cause you could have all the chips, be poor or rich
Still nobody want a nigga having shit
If I ruled the world and everything in it, sky's the limit
I push a Q-45 Infinit
It wouldn't be no such thing as jealousies or B Felonies
Strictly living longevity to the destiny
I thought I'd never see, but reality struck
Better find out before your time's out, what the fuck? 
If I ruled the world 
I'd free all my sons, I love'em love'em, baby
Black diamonds and pearls
If I ruled the world
Silent, silent
Murder
I's sort of like the conclusion to Color Purple
Niggas is losing, confusion, with one time on pursuit moves in
Grabbing niggas up in this movement to rule shit
Cop versus the block, shorties is schooled quick
Lesson number one. If you're arrested and hung
Where niggas is from gotta keep a lid on your tongue
I's like silent murder, I hit blunts hard like Ray Mercer
The violent words of a prince in a palace of Persia
The cognac plurger plus the trees
But who's the foul one to make his nose take a freeze? 
And got enough gall to rock ice in all hype
Used to be a general but just lost his stripe
Pipe dreams and white fiends and all-nighters
Collect calls from lifers, Astoria wars with Cypress
Since I got a problem with the law-writers
I kick some more items just to explore horizons
The palm lady dreamt of this day so I'mma play
The crib close smokin' with the big toast and lay
They say the arms of Nicky Barnes would be enough to blast
A lot of rich niggas fell and started pumping gas
Was it the mind of CIA that bumped off Malik Shabazz
Fuck what they teach in class I'mma reach the mass
Strap up, no back up, it's jungle tactics
Livin' practice, out of line niggas get smacked backwards
So wear it if the cap fits
Folded up money and mad clips
A stack right under my mattress
To smoke a nigga like a Hughes Brother motion picture
Niggas gettin' open crews, roping older niggas
April fools they laugh the jokes on the benches
Cease outside my nigga spoke on his sentence
My right-handers never play too close to cameras
I's night time, scandalous, circle the loud gamblers
Peace making niggas pep talk
The Beast making niggas walk off the hot avenues with they brew
Time to get this loot countless,'cause son it ain't no youth fountains
Niggas take cash and shoot, bounce and Pakistanians are took hostage
Locked up inside a linen closet known for spending pies up
What's the flavor when your neighbors do jake favors? 
Lock the real niggas down and lettin' fake players
Roam around the projects, it's lyrical logic
I dilute, the weak can inject the right composite
When plotting on murderous schemes
It seems I'm ghostly called by the essence of Queens
The palm lady dreamt of this day, so I'mma play
The crib close smokin' with the big toast and lay
And Cain killed his brother Abel
When God accepted Abel's offering and not his
Abel's offering showed that Cain was not giving his best to God
And Cain's jealous anger drove him to murder -
Drove him to murder
Back in the days when I was a teenager
Before I had status and before I had a pager
You could find the Abstract listening to hip hop
My pops used to say, it reminded him of Bebop
I said, 
Well, daddy don't you know that things go in cycles
Way that Bobby Brown is just amping like Michael
I's all expected, things are for the looking
If you got the money, Quest is for the booking
Come on everybody, let's get with the fly mode
Still got room on the truckload of black boom
Listen to the rhymes, then get a mental picture
Of this black man, and black woman fixture
Why do I say that, cos I gotta speak the truth, man
Doing what we feel for the music is the proof and
Planted on the ground, the act is so together
Bona fide strong, you need leverage to sever
The unit, yes the unit, yes the unit called the jazz is
Delivering each year an LP filled with street goods
You can find it on your rack in your record store
If you get the record, say your thoughts are adored
And appreciated, cause we're ever so glad we made it
We work hard, so we gotta thank God
Dishing out the plastic, do the dance till you're spastic
If you diss... it gets drastic
Listen to the rhyme, cause it's time to make gravy
If it moves your booty, then shake, shake it baby
All the way to Africa a.k.a the Motherland
Stick out the left, then I'll ask for the other hand
That's the right hand, Black man
Only if you are noted as my man
If I get the credit, then I think I deserve it
If you fake moves, don't fix your mouth to word it
Get in the zone of positivity, not negativity
Cos we gotta strive for longevity
If you botch up, what's in that 
 A pair of Nikes size ten-and-a-half
 We gotta make moves 
Never, ever, ever could we fake moves 
We gotta make moves 
Never, ever, ever could we fake moves 
We gotta make moves
Never, ever, ever could we fake moves 
We gotta make moves
Never, ever, ever could we fake moves 
Time, time is a ship on a merciless sea
Drifting toward an average of nothingness
Until it can be retarded for its own destiny
Time is an inanimate object
Praying and praying and praying with no justification for relief
Time is dancing, boogalooing away all memories of past
We gotta be a winner all the time
Can't fall prey to a hip hop crime
With the dope raps and dope tracks we move blocks
From the fly girlies to the hardest of the rocks
Musically the Quest, is on the rise
We on these excursions so you must realize
That continually, I pop my Zulu 
If you don't like it, get off the Zulu tip
So what can you do in the times which exist
You can't fake moves on your brother or your sis
But if your sis is a , brother is a jerk
Leave'em both alone and continue with your work
Whatever it may be in today's society
Everything is fair, least that's how it seems to me
You must be honest and true to the next
Don't be phony and expect one not to flex
Especially if you rhyme, you have to live by the pen
Your man is your man, then treat him like your friend
All it is, is the code of the streets
So listen to the knowledge being dropped over beats
Beats that are hard, beats that are funky
They could get you hooked like a crackhead junkie
What you gotta do is know the Tribe is in the sphere
The Abstract Poet, prominent like Shakespeare
We gotta make moves
Never, ever, ever could we fake moves 
We gotta make moves
Never, ever, ever could we fake moves 
We gotta make moves
Never, ever, ever could we fake moves 
We gotta make moves
Never, ever, ever could we fake moves 
Time is running out on black power advocates in the day
And white thigh supporters at night
Every time you see them they're chasing some white woman
With their tongue hanging out
Time is running and passing, passing and running
Running and passing, passing and running...
Yo, microphone check one, two, what is this? 
The five foot assassin with the roughneck business
I float like gravity, never had a cavity
Got more rhymes than the Winans got family
No need to sweat Arsenio to gain some type of fame
No shame in my game cause I'll always be the same
Styles upon styles upon styles is what I have
You wanna diss the Phifer but you still don't know the half
I sport New Balance sneakers to avoid a narrow path
Mess around with this you catch a size eight up your ass
I never half step cause I'm not a half stepper
Drink a lot of soda so they call me Dr. Pepper
Refuse to compete with BS competition
Your name ain't Special Ed
So won't you seckle with the mission
I never walk the street thinking it's all about me
Even though deep in my heart, it really could be
I just try my best to like go all out
Some might even say yo shorty black you're buggin' out
Zulu Nation, brothers last creation
Minds get flooded, ejaculation
Right on the two inch tape
The Abstract poet incognito, runs the cape
Not the best not the worst and occasionally I curse
To get my point across, so bust, the floss
As I go in between, the grit and the dirt
Listen to the mission listen Miss as I do work, umm
As I crack the, monotone
Children of the jazz so, get your own
Smokin R&B cause they try to do me
Or the best of the pack but they can't do rap
For it's Abstract, original
You can't get your own and that's, pitiful
I know I'd be the man if I cold yanked the plug
On R&B, but I can't and that's bugged
Buggin' out, buggin' out, buggin' out, you're buggin' out
Buggin' out, buggin' out, buggin' out, you're buggin' out
Buggin' out, buggin' out, buggin' out, you're buggin' out
Buggin' out, buggin' out, buggin' out, you're buggin' out
Buggin' out, buggin' out, buggin' out, you're buggin' out
Buggin' out, buggin' out, buggin' out, you're buggin' out
Buggin' out, buggin' out, buggin' out, you're buggin' out
Buggin' out, buggin' out, buggin' out, you're buggin' out
Yo when you bug out
You usually have a reason for the action
Sometimes you do it just for mere satisfaction
People be hounding, always surrounding
Pulsing, just like a migraine pounding
You don't really fret, you stay in your sense
Camouflage your feeling, of absolute tense
You soar off to another world, deep in your mind
But people seem to take that, as being unkind
Oh yo he's acting stank,  really on a regal? 
A man of the fame not a man of the people
Believe that if you wanna but I tell you this much
Riding on the train with no dough, sucks
Once again a case of your feet in my Nike's
If a crowd is in my realm I'm saying -- mic please
Hip-hop is living, can't yank the plug
If you do the result, will end up kind of bugged
Yo, I am not an invalid although
I used to smoke the weed out
Ali Shaheed Muhammad used to say I had to be out
Scheming on the cookies with the crazy booming back buns
Pushing on them real hard just so we can have the big fun
When I left for road, see, I was Boulevard status
Battling a MC was when Tip was at his maddest
It was one MC after one MC
What the world could they be wanting see from little old me
Do I have the formula to save the world? 
Or was it just because I used to
Swipe the women and all the girls
I'm the type of brother with the crazy extended hand, kid
Dissed by all my brothers I was all up what my man did
Supposed to be my man
But now I wonder cause you're feeble
I go out with the strongies and I separate the evils
I's your brain against my mind, for those about to boot out
All you nasty critters even though you see I bug out
Buggin' out, buggin' out, buggin' out, you're buggin' out
Buggin' out, buggin' out, buggin' out, you're buggin' out
Buggin' out, buggin' out, buggin' out, you're buggin' out
Buggin' out, buggin' out, buggin' out, you're buggin' out
Buggin' out, buggin' out, buggin' out, you're buggin' out
Buggin' out, buggin' out, buggin' out, you're buggin' out
Buggin' out, buggin' out, buggin' out, you're buggin' out
Buggin' out, buggin' out, buggin' out, you're buggin' out
I's a fly love song
To the effect of nothing, effective fronting
Is what I don't allow so let me tell you something
I am a bonafide
Not too modest and not a lot of pride
Soon to have a ride and a home to reside
If my mama is sick I'm by her bedside
Used to watch the show on Channel 4 called Riptide
Wash my wears in Tide cause it's too damn cold out-tide
That's how the runnings go
If there ain't no dough then there ain't no show
So take your roly poly fat promoter 
To the Chemical Bank, and get my cash
If you wanna see the people scream and laugh
You best Quest, you ask the Quest, you ask real fast
Cause I don't wanna see'em, start bucking
Throwing chairs in the air while you be ducking
What what? Don't step to me with that
If you promoting a show make sure it ain't wack
Or else I'm leaving 
I'm leaving 
I'm leaving 
Your wack show
Yo man what's up with that? 
Yo don't sweat me
C'mon, five hundred, that was the deal
C'mon man, don't try to play me out
We don't need you, sorry! 
And the Abstract rapper says
I want chicken and orange juice, that's what's on my rider
And my occasional potato by Ore-Ida
Don't forget my pastry make sure they're tasty
I'm not the type to be pushy or hasty
See I'm the type of bro that's reared in the ghetto
Took a few shorts before
Now the only ones I take are the ones that I wear
Ain't taking no shorts no more, now
Please act proper'fore I call the Crime
Stoppers
Don't dip on the dough, cause that's a no-no
Make sure you count your money real slow
Be alert, look alive, and act like you know
I's, the 90s, time to make moves
Not, the 80s, do away witcha womb
So what? You got a crew
I got one too, they're called the Brooklyn Zu
Don't break fool, let's be reserved and cool
We don't have to act like we in grade school
Just make sure that we're taken care of
And we'll do a fly show for ya bub, check it out
Diggy dang diggy dang gi-dang gi-dang diggy diggy
Dang diggy dang gi-dang gi-dang diggy diggy
Dang diggy dang gi-dang gi-dang diggy diggy
Dang diggy dang gi-dang gi-dang diggy diggy
1988 senior year at Garvey High
Where all the guys were corny but the girls were mad fly
Lounging with the Tipster, cooling with Sha
Scoping out the honeys—they know who they are
I was the b-ball playing, fly rhyme saying
Fly girl getting but never was I sweating
Cause when it came to honeys I would go on a stroll
Until I met my match—her name was Flo
Yeah, I messed around with the one called Flo
All the troopers round the way used to call her a ho
But deep down in my heart I knew that Flo was good to go
Cause I thought it was me like Bell Biv Devoe
But little did I know that she was playing with my mind
The only thing I learned is good girls are hard to find
I feel like Heavy D, I need somebody for me
Not someone whose mind is blank and tryna juice me for my banks
Swinging with my main man Lucky behind my back
What type of crap is that—yo, how's about a smack? 
Word life, I can't front, thought I was all that
But now it seems, I've met my match
I was a stone cold lover, you couldn't tell me jack
Settling down with one girl, wasn't trying to hear that
I had Tonya, Tamika, Sharon, Karen
Tina, Stacy, Julie, Tracy
Used to love'em, leave'em, skeeze'em, tease'em
Find'em, lose'em - also abuse'em
My whole attitude was new day, next hon
And believe it or not, they all got done
Well here comes Flo, with the crazy whip appeal
And I'm all true man, like Alexander O'Neal
Is this really love, then again how would I know
After all this time trying to be a super ho
She finally played me, but yo I'd find another
Cause I got the crazy game and yo, I'm smooth like butter
Ayo, it's like butter, it's like butter baby
I's like butter, it's like butter baby
I's like butter, it's like butter baby
I's like butter, it's like butter baby
I's like butter, it's like butter baby
I's like butter, it's like the butter baby
Not no Parkay, not no margarine
Strictly butter, strictly butter, baby
I remember when girls were goodie two shoes but now they turning freaks
All of a sudden  ease off ho, my name's Malik
Phife this, Phife that, where you going, where you at
These girls don't know me from jack, yet I feel like the Mack
You didn't want me then, so yo hon, don't want me now
Here, Here - take the towel, wipe off your brow
And take the contact out your eye, you're far from looking fly
You get an E for effort, and T for nice try
Now tell me what's the reason, for dying your hair
Slum village gold still dangling in your ear
You barely have a neck but still sporting a rope
Four-finger ring just so Phifer can scope
You looked in the mirror, didn't know what to do
Yesterday your eyes were brown but today they are blue
Your whole appearance is a lie and it could never be true
And if you really liked yourself then you would try and be you
If your hair and eyes were real, I wouldn't have dissed ya
But since it was bought, I had to dismiss ya
But if you can't achieve it, then why not try and weave it
If you can't extend it then you might as well suspend it
If you can't braid it, best thing to do is fade it
I asked who did your hair and you tell me, 
Diane made it
If you were you and just you, talk to you, maybe
But I can't stand, no bionic lady
Trying hard to look fly, but yo, you're looking dumber
If I wanted someone like you I would've swung with Jaime Sommers
You wanna be treated right, see Father MC
Or check Ralph Tresvant, for sensitivity
Cause I am not the one, I got more game than Parker Brothers
Phife Dawg is on the mic and I'm smooth like butter
I had a dream about my man last night
And my man came by the studio
And his name is...
Busta Rhymes in effect
Shaheed is in effect
Phife Did-awg is in effect
Check it out and give me my'spect
I'm moving, yes I'm grooving cause my mouth is on the motor
Use the Coast in the morning to avoid the funky odor
Can't help being funky, I'm the funky Abstract brother
Funky in a sense, but I play the undercover
Once had a fetish, fetish for some booty
Now I'm getting funky in my rap and that's my duty
Brothers tend to jock on the style in particular
If you got the ego like some brothers then I'll get with ya
But if I don't pursue, then I just don't give a 
My motto in the 90's is be happy making bucks
Girls love the jim, cos it causes crazy friction
When it goes up in and fluctuates the diction
I still understand the oomph cause that's what I met her for
I'm hooked on the swing, so just call me the music whore
Women love the voice, brothers dig the lyrics
Quest the people's choice, we driving for the spirit
If you can't hear it, then get the wax utensil
Write my rhymes straight up, don't give it no fancy stencil
The rhymes be getting sweet, we stay away from tart
A perfectionist at work, perking up the art
If you want to battle, I suggest you check your clock
Your demise is coming up and I want your man to watch
Be the prime example, or deeper still the sample
Insignificance, here I'll place you on the mantle
Born up in Harlem, reside down in Jamaica
The girl I used to rock, her moms was a Quaker
Now what does that make her? The evil money taker? 
The crazy move faker, I use that to break her
Phife is in the house 
Uncle Mike is in the house 
Bob Power is in the house 
Tim Latham is in the house 
Wise Men is in the house
The Brand Nubes is in the house
The J Beez, they in the house
And De La, they in the house
I must regroup my thoughts and kick the next ones for my people
Please don't be deceived by the ugly slice of evil
The world is kinda cold and the rhythm is my blanket
Wrap yourself up in it, if you love it, then you'll thank it
Don't move to rebuttal, wave your hand for action
Some women in the 90's want more than satisfaction
They want keys and Gs, and all those illy things
If you want to, I'll show you, just what the Ab can bring
I keep a tight net with my brothers Ken and Kenny
If the question is of rhymes, then I'll tell ya, I got plenty
The thing that men and women need to do is stick together
Progressions can't be made if we're separate forever
I hooked this funky beat with the loop and the feature
This the funky singing by Miss Vinia Mojica
So listen because the Quest is led through the underground
My people have been oppressed too long, no more will we be down
People tend to riff cause they don't know the mental
People tend to bug cause the beats are hard but gentle
Africano lurks through the body of this youngun'
Play like Bobby Byrd on your back and you're coming to
The house of the jazz, of the funk, of the rhythm
All the goods are welcome, but if you're a villain
I'll just wait and debate, contemplate your arrival
If flexing is your motive, then you don't like survival
The Abstract is speaking, the hard beats is reaching
To Black and Puerto Ricans cause they're butt naked streaking
Through the ever murky streets of the urbanized areas
Blasting out the speakers is the hip hop hysteria
Craig is in the house 
Pete Rock is in the house 
CL is in the house 
Ultramag is in the house 
Nice and Smooth is in the house
Big Daddy Kane is in the house
Beatnuts is in the house
Special Ed is in the house
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
And this one goes out to my man
Thanks a lot Ron Carter on the bass
Yes my man Ron Carter is on the bass
And check it out, going into the'91 decade
Up in until the 2000 decade
You gotta say the Quest is on
And goddamn it, yes the Quest is on
And we out!
Let me tell you'bout the snakes, the fakes, the lies, the highs
At all of these industry shing-dings
Where you see the pretty girls
In the high animated world
Checking for a rapper with all the dough
If you take a shit they want to know
And if you're gonna fall, they won't be around, y'all
So you still wanna do the show business? 
And you think that you got what it takes? 
I mean you really gotta rap, and be all that
And prepare yourself for the breaks
Check it out! 
Do you wanna be in the business? 
The ups and downs with the hoes 
Always getting fronted on at shows 
People gotta stick their nose 
Yo, I gotta speak on the cesspool
I's the rap industry and it ain't that cool
Only if you're on stage or if you're speaking to your people
Ain't no-one your equal
Especially on the industry side
Don't let the gains just glide
Right through your fingers, you gotta know the deal
So Lord Jamar speak, because you're real
They're giving you the business and putting on a show
You're a million dollar man that ain't got no dough
But you got a ho tickets backstage to a show
Sedated and at that fact they elated
Time pass and your ass say 
Where's my loot? 
The reply is a kick in the ass from a leg and a boot
All you wanna do is taste the fruit
But in the back they're making fruit juice
You ask for slack and wanna get cut loose from the label
Not able cause you signed at the table
For a pretty cash advance, now they got a song and dance
That you didn't recoup, 
More soup with your meal? 
Cause this is the real when you get a record deal
And I say...
Aw shucks, look what the cat hauled in
I's Phife Dawg from A Tribe Called Quest, let me begin
Like Chuck D, I got so much trouble on my mind
'Bout these no-talent artists getting signed, they can't rhyme
And if that ain't bad, you got bootleggers
Going out like suckers, motherfuckers
Feel it's time that I let loose the lion
And if not that then I'll commence to head flying
Seems in'91 everybody want a rhyme
And then you go and sell my tape for only $5.99? 
Please nigga, I've worked too hard for this
No more will I take the booty end of the stick
Bogus brothers making albums when they know they can't hack it
Cause they lyrics is played like 8-Ball jackets
Now tell me I can't tear it up
Go get yourself some toilet paper cause your lyrics is butt
Do you wanna be in the business? 
People can't walk a straight line in 
Some of these brothers can't rhyme in 
A-yo, I'm tryna get mine 
The party scene is cool, but then again it's all the same
You see the same faces, but at different places
When you're up and riding high everything is palsy-palsy
Get a million pounds and all the skins give you hugs
Well that's cool, I can dig it, it really ain't my bag
Prefer to max on the side and let my pants sag
Oh, he's a cutie, yeah, real cute
But I wasn't that cute when I didn't have no loot
Although I hit a pound of herbs, I'm still nice with the verbs
So fuck what you heard
The Born Cipher Cipher Master makes me think much faster
But critics still continue to plaster
My name and discredit my fame
All that shit is game and I don't really give a damn
Eat from the tree of life and throw away the verbal ham
Well, excuse me, I gotta add my two cents in
Don't be alarmed, the rhyme was condensed in
A matter of minutes so it must be told
All that glitters not gold
Everybody wants a deal, help me make a demo
See my name in bright lights, ride around in a limo
My moms keeps beefing 
But I wanna make jams, damn, I know I'll slam
Huh, well it's not that easy
You gotta get a label that's willing and able
To market and promote, and you better hope
 That the product is dope
Take it from Diamond, it's like mountain climbing
When it comes to rhyming you gotta put your time in
Get a good lawyer so problems won't pile
You don't wanna make a pitch that's wild
Let me flaunt the style, I think that the time's near
That we drop Scuds, there won't be no duds here
Rappers play the dumb, kinda on the space tip
But when they hear the jams, they be on the dilsnick
Now I'm not for the rock, I know the territory
Go ahead and try, that's a different story
Similar to Grimm, I could tell a better one
All about a kid, who couldn't rap and didn't run
Stands on the side when the mic is getting dumb
Resorts to bagging Billy, asking could he have some
No never ever, go back and try again man
If you come back, I'll be the first to shake your hand
Competition's good, it brings out the vital parts
The Abstract Poetic, majors in recital arts
Do it for the kids, the elders and the rap peers
We know the job is done when we hear a lot of cheers
Gotta feel the vibes, real from my creation
If the hands clap I'm filled with elation
Here I am ghetto, full with a lot of steam
Think I gotta, I think I gotta, I think I gotta scream
Cause that's how good it feels child
Let your hair down, so we can get buckwild
Do your ill dance, don't think about the next man
We must have unity and think of the bigger plan
Division we will fall, we must stick together, see
I'd like to take this time to say what's up to Kool G
The name is Q-Tip, the Midnight Marauder
Giving nuff respects to Afrika Bambaataa
As a man in the world, I must do my job
Take care of Mama Duke, I won't resort to rob
Bob you'll get your dough, Mase is my witness
Obsessed with the rap, for it's the mental fitness
Like shooting Cee-lo, and always hitting head cracks
The industry is luck, winning with the fake raps
Peace to the crews who pump the real hip hop
Not selling out, from hardrock to disc jock
I don't know what to say, but here I go freak it
If the papes come, then you know I'll seek it
I'm just a short brother, dark skin face
Weigh a buck-fifty, 36 waist
Hair is crazy curly, flip like Mr. Furley
To this day I still believe that no MC can serve me
Brothers try to front, but everybody know
I get more props than the Arsenio Hall Show
Party animal I was, but now I chill at home
All I do is write rhymes, eat, drink, shit and bone
Found my thrill in Amityville, I'm always in the Island
Fudge and Lucky know the time, they know who keeps'em smiling
Go out on my own, something that I gotta do
Do what the hell I want and have no one to listen to
I'm prompt with my business and I do things on the double
Yo, I'm out like Buster Douglas, I say peace to MC Trouble
Rest in peace
Word Up, rest in Peace, and you know what else? 
We got, we got, we got the vibes
All the people in Long Island, we got the vibes
Brooklyn and Queens, we got the vibes
Uptown and Now Rule, we got the vibes
People Upstate, we got the vibes
If you're in DC, you got the vibes
Maryland, Virginia, Carolina vibes
Out West, we got the vibes
In the Bahamas, we got the vibes
Over in Europe, you know what, we got the vibes
And we gotta keep it alive, it goes um...
Of rap I'm a fan, I've seen a whole lot of slums
Good with the girls, I get a whole lot of'em
From fat to skinny, Freda to Winnie
Emma to Cindy, Constance to Wendy
Cause I be real friendly, never on the snotty side
I don't brag to brothers about the little papes I got
My vocal styles can vary, the sight is never scary
I's only legendary, my father well prepared me
My job ain't temporary, I'm here for the long shot
Better yet the long term, I don't have a perm
In a way I do, call'em the perma-naps
I'm crazy slap-happy and I'm scrappy and I'm nappy
When I get the mic in my hand with the crowd in the stands
I's as good as grand like that
Yo, I wanna say peace and dedicate this joint to MC Trouble
And to uh... Trouble T Roy
And to um... Scott La Rock
And to um... Cowboy, you know what I'm sayin? 
This is for the slain rappers and the fallen rappers, you know what I'm saying? 
This is a special, special, special, special, special dedication
And also to my Pops and also to Vinia's Moms, you know what I'm saying? 
You just gotta keep it happy and keep the vibes going
Cause this is vibes and stuff, and we out...
Classic, classic...
Classic example of a 
Classic example of a 
Classic example of a 
Classic example of a 
Listen to the rhyme, it's a black ink fact
Percentile rate of date rape is fat
This is all due to the reason of the skeezin
You got the right pickin but you're in the wrong season
If you're in the wrong season, that means you gotta break
Especially if a squaw tries to cry out rape
You be all vexed cause she got it goin on
You don't wanna fight cause you know that you're wrong
So instead you rest your head on the arm of the couch
Envision in your head of a great sex bout
Worthy opponent, all you wanna do is bone it
You ask can you kick it, she says you can't stick it
This is the case, the situation is sticky
Should you try to kiss or hint towards a hickey? 
Not even, you can ask Steven
If the vibe ain't right, huh, ya leavin
Hit the road Jack and all of that
But if she offers her abode, you'll drop ya load
Right smack dab in the middle
Get the kitten, I got crazy tender vittles
Uh-huh, you know the science, you get buckwild
Runnin' mad games as if your name was Scott Skiles
Or better yet Magic or even Karl Malone
Regardless who it is, your aim is to bone
If she tries to front, that's when you start to diss her
If she's with the program, that's when you start to kiss her
Might as well get to the point, no time to waste
Might as well break the ice, then set the pace
You start to talk nasty, now she's ready to bone
Step out of the shower, throw on cologne
All of a sudden, her sugarwalls tumble down like Jericho
She's hotter than Meshach, Shadrach and Abendego
You listen to After 7, break fool after 10
Do your thing at 12 o'clock and when you go again
There goes round 1, ding, there goes round two
Now tell me what the  are you supposed to do? Huh
What do you know, when the meow is completed
Girly girl cried rape, yo, I didn't really need it
Sweetheart, we ain't goin out like that
Sweetheart, we ain't goin out like that
Sweetheart, we ain't goin out like that 
We ain't goin out like that 
We ain't goin out like that
Now baby bust it, if you wanna groove
Me and you can do it, it will be the move
I won't cry over spilled milk
If you won't let me take you to the Hilt
I don't wanna bone you that much
That I would go for the unforbidden touch
I'm not the type that would go for that
I'll have to fetch a brand new cat
Baby, baby, baby I don't wanna be rude
But I know because of your bloody attitude
I know why you act that way
It usually happens on the 28th day
I respect that crazily
When you're done with the pads can you come check me? 
This ain't a joint to disrespect you
Because one head ain't better than two
Check it out
I's a classic example of a 
Uh, uh, uh, uh
Uh, uh, uh, check the rhyme
Back in the days on the boulevard of Linden
We used to kick routines and presence was fittin'
It was I, The Abstract 
Yo, Phife, you remember that routine
That we used to make spiffy like Mr. Clean? 
Heh, okay, you on point Phife? 
You on point Phife? 
You on point Phife? 
Well, then grab the microphone and let your words rip
Now here's a funky introduction of how nice I am
Tell your mother, tell your father, send a telegram
I'm like an energizer'cause, you see, I last long
My crew is never ever wack because we stand strong
Now if you say my style is wack that's where you're dead wrong
I slayed that buddy in El Segundo then Push it Along
You'd be a fool to reply that Phife is not the man
'Cause you know and I know that you know who I am
A special shout of peace goes out to all my pals, you see
And a middle finger goes for all you punk MC's
'Cause I love it when you wack MC's despise me
They get vexed, I roll next, can't none contest me
I'm just a fly MC who's five foot three and very brave
On top remaining, no home training'cause I misbehave
I come correct in full effect have all my hoes in check
And before I get the butt the jim must be erect
You see, my aura's positive I don't promote no junk
See, I'm far from a bully and I ain't a punk
Extremity in rhythm, yeah that's what you heard
So just clean out your ears and just check the word
Check the rhyme y'all, check the rhyme y'all
Check the rhyme y'all, check the rhyme y'all
Check the rhyme y'all, check the rhyme y'all
Check it out, check it out
Check the rhyme y'all, check the rhyme y'all
Check the rhyme y'all, play tapes y'all
Check the rhyme y'all, check the rhyme y'all
Check it out, check it out
Back in the days on the boulevard of Linden
We used to kick routines and the presence was fittin'
It was I, the Phifer 
Ayo Tip, do you recall when we used to rock 
Those fly routines on your cousin's block? 
You on point Tip? 
You on point Tip? 
You on point Tip? 
So play the resurrector and give the dead some life
Okay, if knowledge is the key then just show me the lock
Got the scrawny legs but I move just like Lou Brock
With speed, I'm agile plus I'm worth your while
One hundred percent intelligent black child
My optic presentation sizzles the retina
How far must you go to gain respect? Umm...
Well, it's kind of simple, just remain your own
Or you'll be crazy, sad and alone
Industry rule number four-thousand-and-eighty
Record company people are shady
So kids watch your back'cause I think they smoke crack
I don't doubt it, look at how they act
Well off to better things like a hip-hop forum
Pass me the rock and I'll score'em with decorum
And proper—what you say Hammer? Proper
Rap is not pop, if you call it that then stop
NC, y'all check the rhyme y'all
SC, y'all check it out y'all
Virginia, check the rhyme y'all
Check it out, check it out
In London, check the rhyme, y'all
Everything is fair when you're livin' in the city
Everything is fair when you're livin' in the city
Everything is fair when you're livin' in the city
Everything is fair when you're livin' in the city
Everything is fair when you're livin' in the city
Everything is fair when you're livin' in the city
Everything is fair when you're livin' in the city
Everything is fair when you're livin' in the city
Lookin at Miss Elaine, who runs the fast lane
Barely knows her name, struck by fame
She just got a Benz, she rides with her friends
Gotta keep her beeper in her purse to make ends
Rollin down the block, checkin out the spots
She winks at the cops, always give her props
She knows she's the woman, can't nobody touch her
Hangs out for the loot, makes her papes from the gutter
Tried to make my moves on Miss Elaine, she called me young boy
Told her not to dis me I just want to be your love toy
You young boy, my love toy, I doubt that very highly
Just because you rhyme don't mean I'll let you try me
Business oriented, egos never dented
Always sweet scented, if it's business, she meant it
Distractions never hurt, always did the work
Always was alert, she never got jerked
Queen of the feats, thrive to compete
Love the funky beats while she drive down the street
She was justified, couldn't get a job
Had to feed her family, so she had to play the mob
Pullin out the ooh wop, listenin to doo-wop
 That's all ya heard
 Everything is fair when you're livin' in the city
Everything is fair when you're livin' in the city
Everything is fair when you're livin' in the city
Everything is fair when you're livin' in the city
She's not a big kahuna, wish I met her sooner
Instead, I met her later, my love is much greater
Put me on her roster, to rid her of imposters
And to sell the buddah for the sexy drug ruler
Love is my motive, now I'm drug promotive
Plus I needed ducats to fill up my buckets
Supplied me with the squeezy to make my life easy
Now I'm missing action for this fatal attraction
But don't you let me catch you with your joint up in these bitches
And don't you even dare to plan a plot upon my riches
Cause if you play me out, I think I'll let ya be
I'll be damned if I let a brotha try to gas me
I played my cards well, try to live swell
For the G, I would sell, cuz I was deep in hell
But then I really wasn't, she had a fly cousin
Who would give me booty on the side of my cutie
Elaine, she kinda knew, that I would do the do
But she didn't tear, I did my work with care
That's all that really mattered, her money never splattered
As long as she was paid, she was in the shade
You can't really blame her for holdin on a flamer
Society taught her, but they didn't tame her
A ten clip salute, hunny here's a troop
She will never stop until she reach the top
Top, top...
We got the jazz, we got the jazz
We got the jazz, we got the jazz
We got the jazz, we got the jazz
We got the jazz, we got the jazz
Stern firm and young with a laid-back tongue
The aim is to succeed and achieve at 21
Just like Ringling Brothers, I'll daze and astound
Captivate the mass, cause the prose was profound
Do it for the strong, we do it for the meek
Boom it in your boom it in your boom it in your Jeep
Or your Honda or your Beemer or your Legend or your Benz
The rave of the town to your foes and your friends
So push it, along, trails, we blaze
Don't deserve the gong, don't deserve the praise
The tranquility will make you unball your fist
For we put Hip Hop on a brand new twist
A brand new twist with a whole heap of mystic
So low-key that you probably missed it
And yet it's so loud that it stands in the crowd
When the guy takes the beat, they bowed
So raise up squire, adjust your attire
We have no time to wallow in the mire
If you're on a foreign path, then let me do the lead
Join in the essence of the cool-out breed
Then cool out to the music cause it makes you feel serene
With the birds and the bees and all those groovy things
Like getting stomach aches when you gotta go to work
Or staring into space when you're feeling berserk
I don't really mind if it's over your head
Cause the job of resurrectors is to wake up the dead
So pay attention, it's not hard to decipher
And after the horns, you can check out the Phifer
We got the jazz, we got the jazz
We got the jazz, we got the jazz
We got the jazz, we got the jazz
We got the jazz, we got the jazz
Competition dem try fe come side way
But competition they must come straight way
Competition dem try fe come side way
But competition they must come straight way
How's about that, it seems like it's my turn again
All through the years my mic has been my best friend
I know some brothers wonder, can Phife really kick it? 
Some even wanna dis me, but why sweat it? 
I'm all into my music cos it's how I make papes
Try to make hits, like Kid Capri makes tapes
Me sweat another? I do my own thing
Strictly hardcore tracks, not a new jack swing
I grew up as a Christian so to Jah I give thanks
Collect my banks, listen to Shabba Ranks
I sing, and chat, I do all of that
I's 1991 and I refuse to come wack
I take off my hat to other crews that tend to rock
But the Low End Theory's here, it's time to wreck shop
I got Tip and Shah, so whom shall I fear
Stop look and listen, but please don't stare
So jet to the store, and buy the LP
On Jive/RCA, cassettes and CD's
Produced and arranged by the four-man crew
And oh shit, Skeff Anselm, he gets props too
Make sure you have a system with some fat house speakers
So the new shit can rock, from Bronx to Massapequa
Cause where I come from quality is job one
And everybody up on Linden know we get the job done
So peace to that crew, and peace to this crew
Bring on the tour, we'll see you at a theatre nearest you
Hey yo but wait, back it up, hup, easy back it up
Please let the Abstract embellish on the cut
Back and forth just like a Cameo song
If you dig this joint then please come dance along
To the music cause it's done just for the rhyme
Now I gotta scat and get mine, underline
The jazz, the what? The jazz can move that ass
Cause the Tribe originates that feeling of pizazz
I's the universal sound, bless the brothers on the ground
And the ones six below, you didn't have to go
Some say that I'm eccentric cause I once had an orgy
And sometimes for breakfast I eat grits and porgies
If this is a stinker, then call me a skunk, I ask
 Now check it out
 All my peoples in Queens ya don't stop
Now all my peoples in Brooklyn ya don't stop
And all my peoples uptown ya don't stop
That includes the Bronx and Harlem ya don't stop
Now to that girl Ramelle ya don't stop
I said because Ladies First ya don't stop
And to the JB's, ya don't stop
And De La Soul, ya don't stop
To my Brand Nubians ya don't stop
And to my Leaders of the New ya don't stop
To my man Large Professor ya don't stop
Pete Rock for the beat ya don't stop
Everybody in the place ya don't stop
You keep it on, to the rhythm, ya don't stop
And last but not least on the sure shot
I's the Zulu nation
Do you know the importance of a skypager? 
Uh, uh, uh, uh
Those who don't believe, see you're laid behind
Got our skypagers on all the time
Hurry up and get yours cause I got mine
Especially if you do shows, they come in fine
If you're with a G and you're sipping wine
Eating cacciatore with a twist of lime
Gotta meet your lover at a quarter to 9
Joint by base, then you get your high
If you get your high, then mines is next
The'S' in skypage really stands for sex
Beeper's going off like Don Trump gets checks
Keep my bases loaded like the New York Mets
At times I miss the pager so you don't get vex
Having bad days like a voodoo hex
Conceptually, a pager is so complex
That I be standing by the phone, ready to flex
Welcome, wel-wel-welcome to the new skypager
Wel-welcome to the new skypager
Welcome to the new skypager, new skypaper
Enter telephone number or other numeric message
Uh, so funky
Uh, so funky
Uh, so funky
Uh, so funky
The batteries I use are called Duracell
They last for three weeks so they do me well
Don't be going through no phases, my joint stays on
24-7, from dusk til dawn
If you're in Costa Rica on a sunlit beach
You greed for the Phifer, I can be reached
A number of importance, I just put it on lock
You leave code'69, that means you want some 
People tend to think that a pager's foul
Well it kinda is cause it makes me scowl
But it really hurts when you're on the prowl
Brothas know it hurts when you're on the prowl
Grabbin' on my joint cause I'm an eager owl
Get paged by a G or a business pal
My shit is overflowin', they won't allow
Another page, so I'll just end this now
Babies babble on, they lookin for excuses
Game for the buzzer who kicked it to the mooses
Lame as a brain, could be, golly gee
If you see a shrink he'll charge you a fee
If you see me ya see the fee is nothing
Fee will be for patience, all backs no fronting

Here we go, yo, here we go, yo
So what, so what, so what's the scenario? 
Here we go, yo, here we go, yo
So what, so what, so what's the scenario? 
Ayo, Bo knows this 
And Bo knows that 
But Bo don't know jack,'cause Bo can't rap
Well, what do you know? The Di-Dawg is first up to bat
No batteries included and no strings attached
No holds barred, no time for move-fakin'
Gots to get the loot so I can bring home the bacon
Brothers front, they say the Tribe can't flow
But we've been known to do the impossible like Broadway Joe, so
Sleep if you want, Ny
Quil will help you get your Z's, troop
But here's the real scoop
I'm all that and then some, short, dark, and handsome
Bust a nut inside your eye to show you where I come from
I'm vexed, fuming, I've had it up to here
My days of paying dues are over, acknowledge me as in there 
Head for the border, go get a taco
Watch me wreck it from the jump street, meaning from the get-go
Sit back, relax, and let yourself go
Don't sweat what you heard, but act like you know
Yes, yes, y'all, 
Who got the vibe? I's the Tribe, y'all 
Real live, y'all 
Inside, outside, come around
Brown! 
Some may, I say, call me Charlie
The word is the herb and I'm deep like Bob Marley
Lay back on the payback, evolve rotate the gates
Can I get a hit? 
Boom, bip with a brother named Tip, and we're ready to flip
East coast stomping, ripping, and romping
New York, North Cak-a-laka, and Compton
Checka-checka-check it out
The loops for the troops, more bounce to the ounce
And wow-how-now-wow, how now, Brown cow? 
We're ill'til the skill gets down
For the flex, next, it's the textbook, old to the new
But the rest are doo-doo
From radio, to the video, to Arsenio
Tell me, yo; what's the scenario? 
Scooby Doo, whoopie doo
Scenarios, radios, rates more than four
Scores for the s'mores that smother dance floors
Now I go for mine, shades of sea shore
Ship-shape, crushed grapes, apes that play tapes
Papes make drakes baked for the wakes
Of an , an , simply just a leader
Base in the space means peace, see ya later
Later  later, alligator
Pop blows the weasel and the herb's the inflater
So, yo, the D, what the O
Incorporate I-N-C into a flow
Funk flipped, flat back, first this foul fight, fight, fight
Laugh, yo, how'd that sound? 
I's a Leader-Quest mission and we got the goods here 
Never on the left'cause my right's my good ear 
I could give a damn about a ill subliminal
Stay away from crime so I ain't no 
I love my young nation, groovy sensation
No time for hibernation, only elation
Don't ever try to test the water, little kid
Yo, Mr. Busta Rhymes, tell him what I did—
—I heard you rushed and rushed 
Then they rebuked and you 
Causing rambunction throughout the sphere
Raise the levels of the boom inside the ear—
—You know I did it
So don't violate or you'll get violated
The hip-hop sound is well agitated
Won't ever waste no time on a played out ego
So here's Busta Rhymes with the scenario:
Watch; as I combine all the juice from the mind
Heel up, wheel up, bring it back, come, rewind
Powerful impact  from the cannon! 
Not bragging, tryna read my mind, just imagine
Vo-cab-u-lary's necessary
When diggin' into my library
Oh, my gosh! Oh, my gosh! 
Eating Ital Stew like the one Peter Tosh
Unh! Unh! Unh! All over the track, man
Unh, pardon me, unh! As I come back! 
As I did it, yo, I had to beg your pardon
When I travel through the town I roll with the squadron
Rawr! Rawr! Like a dungeon dragon
Change your little drawers'cause your pants were saggin'
Try to step to this, I will twist you in a turban
And have you smelling ripe, like some old, stale urine
Chickity Choco, the chocolate chicken
The rear cock diesel, buttcheeks, they were kicking
Yo, bust it out before the Busta bust another rhyme
The rhythm is in sync  the rhymes are on time 
Rippin' up the sound just like Horatio
Observe the vibe and check out the scenario
Yeah, my man, mothafucka! 
Here we go, yo, here we go, yo
So what, so what, so what's the scenario? 
Here we go, yo, here we go, yo
So what, so what, so what's the scenario? 
Here we go, yo, here we go, yo
So what, so what, so what's the scenario? 
Here we go, yo, here we go, yo
So what, so what, so what's the scenario?Hello, this is your Midnight Marauder program
I am on the front of your cover

When the mic is in my hand, I'm never hesitant
My favorite jam back in the day was Eric B. for Presi...
Rude boy composer, step to me you're over
Brothers wanna flex, you're not Mad Cobra
MC shorty black, there ain't no other
Trini-born lad like Nia Long's grandmother
Tip and Sha they all that, Phife Dawg ditto
Honey tell your man to chill, or else you'll be a widow
Did not you know that my styles are top-dollar? 
The Five-Foot Assassin knocking fleas off his collar
Hip hop scholar since being knee high to a duck
The height of Muggsy Bogues, complexion of a hockey puck
You better ask somebody on how we flip the script
Come to a Tribe show and watch the three kids rip
Queens is in the house represent, represent
A Tribe Called Quest represent, represent
No taming of the style cause it gets irreverent
A Tribe Called Quest represent, represent
Huh-huh, here we go, you know that I'm the rebel
Throwing out the wicked like God did the Devil
Funky like your grandpa's drawers, don't test me
We in like that, you're dead like Presley
When we coming through get tickets to see me
We work for the paper so there'll never be a freebie
Lyrics are abundant cause we got it by the mass
Egos are all idle cause the music is the task
Valenzuela on the pitch, curveball, catch it
I think I got it locked, just smooth while I latch it
Right, now I must move with the quickness
Here comes Shaheed so we must bear the witness
Stir it up! Stir it up! Stir it up! 
Steve Biko
Stir it up! Stir it up! Stir it up! 
Steve Biko
New York City represent, represent
A Tribe Called Quest represent, represent
The Dawg is scientific with the styles I invent
A Tribe Called Quest represent, represent
MCs like to meddle, but here's my proposition
I let my lyrics flow, and juxt your whole position
I'm radical with this like the man this song is after
Yo Tip settle down, what's the reason for the laughter? 
Yo I'll take it back, I'm the Indian giver
MCs take notes as I stand and deliver
Percussion isn't less, Ds wear the vest
Why they dodging bullets, you should be dodging Quest
Don't get me wrong, violence is not our forte
I just like to rhyme, kick the lyric skills like Pelé
Tip educate'em, my rhymes are strictly taboo
Fill'em with some fantasies and I'll look out like Tattoo
Ok, I am recognizing that the voice inside my head
Is urging me to be myself but never follow someone else
Because opinions are like voices, we all have a different kind
So just clean out all of your ears, these are my views and you will find
That we revolutionize over the kick and the snare
The ghetto vocalist is on a state-wide tear
Soon to be the continent and then the freaking globe
There's room for it all as we mingle at the mall
We welcome competition cause it doesn't make one lazy or worn
We gotta work hard, you know the damn card
Try to be the phattest is the level that we strive
Try to be the phattest also to stay alive

Oaktown, LA, San Fran, St. John
People give your ears so I be sublime
I's enjoyable to know you and your concubines
Niggas, take off your coats, ladies act like gems
Sit down, Indian style, as we recite these hymns
See, lyrically I'm Mario Andretti on the MOMO
Ludicrously speedy, or infectious with the slow-mo
Heard me in the eighties, J.B.'s on 
The Promo
In my never-ending quest to get the paper on the caper
But now, let me take it to the Queens side
I'm taking it to Brooklyn side
All the residential Questers who invade the air
Hold up a second son, cause we almost there
You can be a black man and lose all your soul
You can be white and groove but don't crap the roll
See my shit is universal if you got knowledge of dolo
Or delf or self, see there's no one else
Who can drop it on the angle, acute at that
So, do that, do that, do do that that that 
Do that, do that, do do that that that 
Do that, do that, do do that that that
I'm bugging out but let me get back cause I'm wetting niggas
So run and tell the others cause we are the brothers
I learned how to build mics in my workshop class
So give me this award, and let's not make it the last
We on Award Tour with Muhammad my man

Going each and every place with the mic in their hand

Back in'89 I simply slid in the place
Buddy, buddy, buddy all up in your face
A lot of kids was busting rhymes but they had no taste
Some said Quest was wack, but now is that the case? 
I have a quest to have a mic in my hand
Without that, it's like Kryptonite and Superman
So Shaheed come in with the sugar cuts
Phife Dawg's my name, but on stage, call me Dynomutt
When was the last time you heard the Phife sloppy
Lyrics anonymous, you'll never hear me copy
Top notch baby, never coming less
Sky's the limit, you gots to believe up in Quest
Sit back, relax, get up out the path
If not that, here's a dancefloor, come move that ass
Non-believers, you can check the stats
I roll with Shaheed and the brother Abstract
Niggas know the time when Quest is in the jam
I never let a statue tell me how nice I am
Coming with more hits than the Braves and the Yankees
Living mad phat like an oversized mampi
The wackest crews try to diss, it makes me laugh
When my track record's longer than a DC-20 aircraft
So, next time that you think you want somethin here
Make something def or take that garbage to St. Elsewhere

Seven times out of ten we listen to our music at night, thus spawned the title of this program
The word maraud means to loot
In this case, we maraud for ears
Went to Carvel to get a milkshake
This honey ripped me off for all my loot cakes
The car oh yeah there's money in my jacket
Somebody broke into my ride and cold macked it
Yo Tip I tell you man the devil's tryin' it
But I'm goin' to stay strong cause I ain't buyin' it
Tonight I'm taking Sherry out, I don't have jack to wear
You know I gots to look dipped in the fresh new gear
Cool I found something so I ironed it
I then got caught up on the phone, oh shit, I'm frying it
Will someone tell me what did I do to deserve this? 
I think I'll, pull out my suit for Sunday service
My little brother wants Barney, cool, I'm gettin' it
Took him down to Kay-Bee, they ain't sellin' it
Here we go with the crying, yo he's throwing fits
My blood pressure's blowing up, I can't take the shit
Finally got what he wanted, now he's good to go
Again the ride was smashed, where's my radio? 
One time, the car was in the shop I had to borrow see...
They had no mercy on the car, Lyor will kill me
Where the hell can Nicki be? I'm gonna smack her up
I got the tickets for the Knicks and she cold stood me up
I need to hit a honey off, Jarobi pass the phone
Pulled out my book of hoes, oh yo, Sheila's home
Steady smiling like a mother yo I'm read' to bone
Went down on hon, she's in the red zone
Stressed out more than anyone could ever be
Forever tryin' to clear the samples for my new LP
Everybody knows I go to Georgia often
Got on the flight and I ended up in Boston
With all these trials and tribulations, yo, I've been affected
And to top it off, Starks got ejected
Problems, problems, problems
Woe is me I'm having problems, problems, problems
Just last week my girl was stressin' me
Now her best friend be undressing me
Well I was loving her by the moon ray
Now I'm tricking on her like Kinte' 
Bought a bag of izm from the smoke shop
Walking towards the car, here come the damn cops
Now I'm station bound for the Thai sticks
I bought it for my man, I don't believe this shit
Coach sat me down from the ball team
Cause I was breaking niggas on the inseams
Some niggas cross town was trying to stick me
All I had was shorts, a dollar fifty
Picked up this girl in the hooptie
Just because I rhyme she tried to soup me
Pay for this, pay for that, loot for nails and hair
Who the hell you think I am, Mr. Belvedere? 
Go and get a bloody job, then can we look cute
Even if you give me boots, you'll never see my loot
She wasn't even all of that, just another hooker
So I turned that ass away, quick like Chuckii Booker
Sometimes you got put the hoes in their friggin' place
Just move from in front me with your batty face! 
Problems, problems, problems
Lord knows I'm havin' problems, problems, problems
Jesus Christ I'm havin' problems, problems, problems
Pray for me I'm havin' problems, problems, problems
Yeah
Yeah
Just lay down your burdens by the riverside
Hah, and you'll be alright, know what I'm sayin'? 
Love and peace from Phife for'93, know what I'm sayin'? 
Tribe Called Quest, Shaheed and Tip
This is how we flip
My man Muhammad in the house, huh 
Zulu Nation in the house, huh 
Subroc is in the house, huh 
My man Skeff is in the house, huh 
Jarobi White is in the house, huh 
Bob Power in the house, huh 
My man Eric in the house, huh 
My man Litro in the house, huh 
Help me out y'all, help me out now
Help me out y'all, help me out now
Help me out God, I really need ya
Help me out now, I really need ya
Help me out y'all, help me out now
I'm having problems, help me out now
Really need ya, to help me out now
Help me out y'all, help me out now
Help me out y'all, help me out now
Help me out y'all, help me out now
Help me out God, I really need ya
Havin problems, help me out now
Hey sucker nigga, whoever you are
Hey sucker nigga, whoever you are
Hey sucker nigga, hey sucker nigga
Whoever you are, whoever you are
I be hating sucker MCs, and the sucker niggas
Posing like they hard when we know they damn card
What you figure, rhyme-wise I do the figure eight so concisely
Musically we are the herb so sit back and light me
Inhale...
My style is kinda fat reminiscent of a whale
Young girls desires older female dreams
I be the Abstract Poetic representing from Queens
Socially I'm not inane, black and white got game
If you came to the jam, well I'm glad you came
See, nigga first was used back in the Deep South
Falling out between the dome of the white man's mouth
It means that we will never grow, you know the word dummy
Upper niggas in the community think it's crummy
But I don't, neither does the youth cause we em-
Brace adversity it goes right with the race
And being that we use it as a term of endearment
Niggas start to bug, to the dome is where the fear went
Now the little shorties say it all of the time
And a whole bunch of niggas throw the word in they rhyme
Yo I start to flinch, as I try not to say it
But my lips is like the oowop as I start to spray it
My lips is like a oowop as I start to spray it
My lips is like a oowop as I start to spray the
Sucka nigga, nigga nigga
I throw the sucka in the front for the ones that front
I's the neo-nigga of the nineties c'mon
Aiyyo Shaheed, take us the fuck outta here
You're not any less of a man, if you don't pull the trigger
You're not necessarily a man, if you do
The night is on my mind
The sun'll still shine
But the night is on my mind
So parlay while I drop this rhyme
See, Jake be gettin illy when the sun get dark
He be coming out for heads but shit don't let me start
There's activities a-plenty in the nighttime
For the ghetto child it seem to be the right time
See, kids be getting stuck with jewels and fly gimmicks
Shorty see the action and then start to mimic
Running to the corner, the dice game is blazing
Looking at the loot, it seems so amazing
Puts the short down, to be exact one pound
He shakes the stones in his hand, then he lets it down
Scared money don't make none
He threw a trip on the ace now he's out son
Hits the local bodega to wolf down a hero
Son is on a midnight run like De Niro
Spots a shorty rock standing on his block
The fiends be hounding him to pump, so he adds to his knot
Conversation that he kicked to the shorty was a sly one
Increased intensity, cause damn she was a fly one
Took her to the crib there she ran her jibs
About mind upliftment and being positive
He yawned and he sighed til 1:05
Then he finally realized that honey wasn't live
At least he didn't plan on building for the evening
Threw the Fila on the dome and said'Come on yo, we leaving'
Came out on the scene as he told her to beep him
Saw his man Stan with the blunt in his hand
 You know the transaction
Brothers gettin lost in the weed satisfaction
Coming down the block man loud as 
You would swear Redman was inside the truck
As the night seemed darker, cops is on a hunt
They interrupt your cipher, and crush your blunt
See you left your work at home so they pat you down for nothing
Why in the hell does 10-4 keep fronting
You push to the park even though it's still dark
The kid is nice on the hoop, he said'I'll spot you troop'
The night is on my mind
The sun’ll still shine
But now the night is on the mind
The night is on the mind
The night is on yo mind
Ayo, the sun’ll still shine
But now the night is on the mind
As for me I'm a nocturnal animal, God concentrates
On a young black man who makes the niggas speakers shake
The nighttime is busy, it's word to Aunt Kizzy
I's the time we get down, yo son, you know the sound
The flavas on the top with the rugged beat to back it
The night makes the aura and the Jake can't hack it
The way the moon dangles in the midnight sky
And the stars dance around, a-yo I think it's fly
Intensity, most rappers don't see it
Spirit wise, musically, you gotta be it
Serenity and silence of the sounds and emotions
In the concrete jungle when the sun don't bungle
I think it's hard to find the words on how I feel
I paid about a deuce twenty for the Ampex steel
But let me slow down, I think I ran my jibs enough
Peace out to the Nation, stay rugged and rough
The night is on my mind
The sun’ll still shine
The night is on my mind
The night is on my mind
The night is on my mind
Yeah, the sun’ll still shine
But now the night is on my mind
Uh-huh, the night is on my mind
The night is on yo mind
You know the sun’ll still shine
But now the night is on the mind
Yeah, the night is on the mind
The night is on the mind
Ayo, the sun’ll still shine
But now the night is on the mind
Yeah, the night is on the mind
The night is on the mind
Ayo, the sun’ll still shine
Did you know that the rate of AIDS in the Black and Hispanic community is rising at an alarming rate? 
Education is proper means for slowing it down
We can get down, we can we can get down 
I's like that man, it's like that  
Check it! 
I'm not your average MC with the Joe Schmoe flow
If you don't know me by now, you'll never know
Stepping on my critics, beating on my foes
The plan is to stay focused, only then I can grow
Straight from the heart, I represent hip hop
I be three albums deep, but I don't wanna go pop
Too many candy rappers seem to be at the top
Too much candy is no good, so now I'm closing the shop
Crushing competition like Italians on grapes
My rhymes styles be blending like a Ron G tape
My man where ya going, you can't escape
When the Tribe is in the house that means nobody is safe
How can a reverend preach, when a rev can't define
The music of our youth from 1979
We rap by what we see, meaning reality
From people busting caps and like Mandela being free
Not every MC be with the negativity
We have a slew of rappers pushing positivity
Hip hop will never die yo, it's all about the rap
So Mayor Barry smoking crack, let's preach about that
The trash you talk won't matter, that old bogus chatter
The more that you condemn us, it only makes us phatter
When I talk, I know I'm talking for Hip Hoppers all around
You know you love the sound, we gets down
I'm the cherry on the top of yo ice cream
I'm the mystic thought inside your dream
Listen to the way we pulsate the jam
I'm the nigga here with the mic in hand
Styles that we present are just a few
To do away with you and your hum drum crew
This is'93 and the shit is real
Black people unite and put down your steel
Ladies make a forum on your sexual drive
Devote it to your lover and make it thrive
The rhythm's in F, I'm a hip hop body
Release my energy with the force of a shotty
Standing on the wall with my Polo on
Talking to the girl with the Liz Claiborne
Keep the poetry in my black knapsack
Got my Timbo hooves and my Doublemint pack
Hit the city streets to enhance my soul
I can kick a rhyme over ill drum rolls
With a kick, snare, kicks and high hat
Skilled in the trade of that old boom bap
I can do a trick with the opposite breed
I used to down 40s and smoke grade weed
Now, I'm doing shows with half loot down
Now it's time for me to take ya uptown
I's like that man, it's like that  
I's like this, Shaheed! 
Shaheed:(until end)
Rakim: 
Why waste time on the microphone
A Tribe Called Quest consists of four members:
Phife Dawg, Ali Shaheed Muhammad, Q-Tip, and Jarobi
A E I O U and sometimes Y
Relax yourself girl, please set-tle down
Relax yourself girl, please set-tle down
Relax yourself girl, please set-tle down
Relax yourself girl, please set-tle down
Honey, check it out, you got me mesmerized
With your black hair and your fat-ass thighs
Street poetry is my everyday
But yo, I gotta stop when you trot my way
If I was working at the club you would not pay
Aiyyo, my man Phife Diggy, he got something to say
I like'em brown, yellow, Puerto Rican or Haitian
Name is Phife Dawg from the Zulu Nation
Told you in the jam that we can get down
Now let's knock the boots like the group H-Town
You got BBD all on your bedroom wall
But I'm above the rim and this is how I ball
A gritty little something on the New York street
This is how I represent over this here beat
Talking'bout you
Yo, I took you out
But sex was on my mind for the whole damn route
My mind was in a frenzy and a horny state
But I couldn't drop dimes cause you couldn't relate
Relax yourself girl, please set-tle down
Relax yourself girl, please set-tle down
Relax yourself girl, please set-tle down
Relax yourself girl, please set-tle down
Stretch out your legs, let me make you bawl
Drive you insane, drive you up the wall
Staring at your dome-piece, very strong
Stronger than pride, stronger than Teflon
Take you on the ave and you buy me links
Now I wanna pound the poontang until it stinks
You can be my mama and I'll be your boy
Original rude boy, never am I coy
You can be a shorty in my ill convoy
Not to come across as a thug or a hood
But hon, you got the goods, like Madelyne Woods
By the way, my name's Malik
The Five-Foot Freak
Let's say we get together by the end of the week
She simply said, 
No, labelled me a ho
I said, 
How you figure?  
My friends told me so
I hate when silly groupies wanna run they yap
Word to God, hon, I don't get down like that
I'll have you weak in the knees that you could hardly speak
Or we could do like Uncle L and swing an ep in my jeep
Keep it on the down, yo, we keep it discreet
See, I'm not the type of kid to have my biz in the streets
If my mom don't approve, then I'll just elope
Let me save the little man from inside the boat
Let me hit it from the back, girl I won't catch a hernia
Bust off on your couch, now you got Seaman's Furniture
Shaheed, Phife and the Extra P
Stacy Beadle, PJ and my man L.G
They know the Abstract is really soul on ice
The character is of men, never ever of mice
Shorty let me tell you about my only vice
It has to do with lots of loving and it ain't nothing nice
Relax yourself girl, please set-tle down
Relax yourself girl, please set-tle down
Relax yourself girl, please set-tle down
Relax yourself girl, please set-tle down
Keep bouncing
Brothers know the flavs when the Quest gets loose
Slamming sucker fuckers like the wrestler Zeus
Crazier than 2Pac in the flick called Juice
Cock is longer than the hat worn by Dr. Seuss
Love a girl in Daisy Dukes like them kids called Duice
Gets paid to sex the hoochie like my main man Luke
Control the mic like Denzel on the girls
Wack MCs be on the nuts like Rocket J. Squirrel
The worst thing in the world is a sucker MC
Favorite rap group in the world is EPMD
Can't forget the De La, due to originality
And if I ever went solo my favorite MC would be me
Phife Dawg up in the house, I give a shout out to Snoopy
Peace to all the Questers, to hell with the groupies
Like um, Ralph Malph to Potsie, Brooklyn to Dodger
Laverne to Shirley, Rerun to Roger
Ren to the Stimpy, Laurel to Hardy
Q-Tip and Phife, they mash up the party
Kick the rhymes and more rhymes
Kick the beats and more beats
We'll have you scratching in your head like Shaheed on Technics
For those who wanna oppose then take a stand
But for now, just shut your shit and clap your hands
You just wanna dance man, then clap your hands
If you venture up the wrong road, then the circumstance
Will be crucial, I got hundreds of rhymes that'll suit you
So listen
The Abstract intuition is very very worthy
I can feel ya out from Russia to Jersey
Can't understand the underground, it gets deep
The Lo, the Nikes, the links, the jeeps
The women, the lingo, and all the other goods
Peace to the hoods, keep my shit on play
Please don't do the mute when you hear me on the juke
Brothers know the angle, it's the Star-Spangled black banner
Hook up the beats at the funk manor
If you want a roll, then the dough I be raking
The scope is on the world cos it's mine for the taking
You know I'm gonna do it
My shit is rock solid, but it flows like fluid
Chemists get confused of my ill composition
This is the third of the new Tribe addition
MCs be swinging, but a lot of them be missing
So shut your bloodclot and listen
Cuz I'm bringin you the ill rendition
I'd like to send this out to the L.E.S
Gotta a lot of rhythm and style and finesse
Come here love, hot sex on a plat
And when you're done with that then clap
 - repeat until end
 Keep bouncing
Listen up everybody, the bottom line
I'm a black intellect, but unrefined
With precision like a bullet, target bound
Just living like a hooker, the harlot sounds
Now when I say the harlot, you know I mean the hot
Heat of the equator, the broth that's in the pot
Jalick, Jalick ya wind up ya hip
Drafting of the poets, I'm the #7 pick
Licks licks licks boy'pon your backside
Licks licks licks boy'pon your backside
Listen to the fader, Shaheed lets it glide
Tip the earthly body, heaven's on my side
Even in Santo Domingo when I got a Gringo
We got mics, when do we go? 
Know a little nigga who can rhyme when you ask me
Short, dark, and plus his voice is raspy
1 for the treble, 2 for the bass
You know the style Tip, it's time to flip this
I like my beats hard like two day old shit
Steady eating booty MCs like cheese grits
My man Al B. Sure, he's in effect mode
Used to have a crush on Dawn from En Vogue
I's not like honey dip would wanna get with me
But just in case I own more condoms than T.L.C
Now the formula is this: me, Tip, and Ali
For those who can't count it goes 1-2-3
The anti batty boy, big up is who I be
Brothers find this hard to do but never me
Some brothers try to diss but Malik, you see'em bitching
Me no care about them dibby MC, my shit is hitting
Trini gladiator, anti-hesitater
Shaheed push the fader from here to Grenada
Mr Energetic, who me sound pathetic? 
When's the last time you heard a funky diabetic? 
Oh my God, yes, oh my God
Complementary are we, the three for poetry
I got a humdinger coming hook line and sinker
The Timbo hoofs with the prints on the ground
Timbos on the toes, I like the way it's going down
Down like a lady of the evening
When it goes in Toots just believe it's in
Cause Queens is the county, Jamaica is the place
Take off your cleats cause you can't run the race
The title MC means Master of Ceremony
Some people who MC don't know what this term means
A-yo swing swing swing, to chop chop chop
Yo that's the sound when MC's get mopped
Don't come around town without the hip in your hop
Cause when the shit hits the fan, that ass'll get dropped
MC's wanna attack me but them punks can't cope
I'll have you left without a job, like Isaac from The Love Boat
So money watch your mouth, or I'mma have to bust ya
Battling MC's, from JFK to Russia
Back down to London, Sweden and Brazil
Do a U.S. tour for three months and then I chill
Styles be fat like Jackie Gleason, the rest be Art Carney
People love the Dawg like the kids love Barney
I love you, you love me
The shorty Phife Dawg is your favorite MC
So move back yaself dread, you know the element
The Tribe is good for your health like a can of Nutrament
MC's don't have no wins, MC's don't have no 
I flip shit crazier than a busload full of Jerry's Kids
Your crew don't want it and your crew don't want it
But if you feel you can swing it, then money please bring it
Large Professor in the house, you know how we do
I skate on your crew, like Mario Lemieux
Peace to Ike Love and the rest of the crew
I'll meet you guys in front the cleaners, bring the blunts and the brew so...
Whassup kids? The Ab is speaking from the moon
Thanks for your support, a-yo I'll be home soon
But the only thing I ask when I return from my task
Is a whole bunch of beats and a flask full of ass
My fist stands firm because I'm, black and solid
I open up your pores like a plate full of collards
C'mon take it easy wouldya, easy easy
I'm up in the gulley, that's when I am her Buddy
She told me pull her hair, I did, it drove her nutty
Filled up the hole like spackle or I mean putty
When we over joints like this we never cruddy
Extra P hooked the beat, and kid that feels luh-ove-ly
Check it out, cause my conception is immaculate
A bachelor, looking for a bachlelorette
Back to you MC's, this is what you're gonna get
A first degree burn from my man Ken's cigarette
I hope you like Malboro
Paul, you know we thorough like Denver
The beat feels like a never-ender
But all things good must, so I won't sweat it
Drop the seeds for the youthful crew, I hope you get it
As I stand, grip this mic inside my hand
Boy I smack you up, like I was your old grand
So respect yourself Son, and come and gimme love
Once again the Ab is who you think of
So chill with the beef money, we gotta dead it
I's Extra P and yo Tip I'm bout to set it
On the country once again here to win
I'm Uptown chilling, taking in this Grandmaster Vic blend
From the projects, the PJ's, fuck them two DJs
Self mission, I had her in the ill position saying
Large you's the soul brother that I'd like to eff with for the rest of my life
Yeah yeah now check the method
As I, proceed with what you need like Akinyele
A whip looks complete when the tires say Pirelli
Funk monkey, one rapper fell off, now he's a junkie
There's 8 million stories in the city it's a pity
Don't fuck with the skins if she's trying to act shitty
Big shout to the Guru, Primo and Zulu
Nation, was on a vacation, in the ghetto
Yo Ras slow your roll I'm bout to bag this here's metal
Rapper Nas on top it seems we gonna rock it
Queens represent, buy the album when I drop it
I'm bound to wreck your body and say turn the party out
I'm bound to wreck your body and say turn the party out
I'm bound to wreck your body and say turn the party out
I'm bound to wreck your body and say turn the party out
I'm bound to wreck your body and say turn the party out
I'm bound to wreck your body and say turn the party out
I'm bound to wreck your body and say turn the party out
I'm bound to wreck your body and say turn the party out
I'm bound to wreck your body and say turn the party out
Them can't touch we, no them can't touch we
Them can't hold we, no them can't hold we
Them can't touch we, no them can't touch we
Them can't hold we, no them can't hold we
Yeah, I know it looks pathetic
Ali Shaheed Muhammad got me doing calisthenics
Needless to say boy I'm bad to the bone
Making love to my mic like Jarobi on the phone
But um, no time for jokes, there's bills to be paid
Hoes to be laid, punks to be sprayed
Chumps to attack, so my man watch your back
'93 means skills are a must, so never lack
Sit back and learn, come now watch the birdie
Your styles are incomplete, same as Vinny Testaverde
Battling, whenever -- hot Damn! 
Give me the microphone boy, one time, bam! 
Keep it on the cooler cos here come the heat
Lyrically in space the jazz will pace the beat
As we proceed to elevate you we in 4/4
Run and tell your dad the Abstract's the bad
As we proceed to move your hind parts we know as ass
Poets got the gimmicks, but they lack the sassafras
To make the average hardrocker cock the Glock
And roam the city streets on the jury, they hot
I be ingredients, like sugar in candy
If your life is broke, girl I'll be the handy-dandy
That can mend you, my fee is a shower
For you, I scrub the back and I floss the butt crack
Make you shiny, spiffy in a jiff
Fucking with the Ab, you got the greatest of gifts
A-yo, my mic is sounding bugged, Bob Power, you there? 
Adjust the bass and treble make my shit sound clear
Move back yourself man, come watch me drop it
For sure me a go do it, for sure me a go rock it
Me not deal with no changaram, bangaram business
I got soul on the end, like Jehovah's got the witness
Musically, the three, poetically we be
The enchantment on the airwaves, kids just fade
Obey the MCs, cos the MCs say
We flipping on niggas like we Super Dave
But noticing my stature, y'all niggas know we gotcha
Moving to the rapture, listen how we catch ya
Moving with the grace, here we go, let's begin
Making people jump out their goddamn skin
Lyrically, we bite like we Rin Tin Tin
Peace to Grand Pu and his many many skins
Don't mark us for the'L' cos you know we get the wins
I's the Ab, Shaheed, and the Dawg for the blend
And I wanna say peace to my man Bob P, my man Jerod  
And Skeff Anslem on the help out - and we out like shout
Nine-tre, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh...
I don't wanna say nine-tre
Cause my man Extra P said don't say the years
So, it's for eternity, know what I'm saying? 
Rock rock on, everybody in Queens, rock rock on
Everybody in Brooklyn, rock rock on
Money Earnin' Mt. Vernon, rock rock on

Lyrics to go  uhh
Lyrics to go  ahh yeah, c'mon
Lyrics to go 
Lyrics to go  yeah yeah
Lyrics to go 
Goin on and on to the rhythmic variation
Wakin in the morning I still represent the nation
When I speak of nation please don't make the deviation
Rebels of the party who create the drum sensation
Mind is a pit of different information
Microphone is on so of course communication
Bogle at the party then you got the bogle-ation
Decaptatin foes yo as if my name was Jason 
Makin all the fellas at the party lose composure
Hook up the beat with the mic and it's over 
A Tribe Called Quest we on the run for whatever
Trials and tribulations that we have to endeavor
Brothers know my steelo it's a letter to the better
If you see a shorty that you like, then you sweat her
Silly with the microphone, in other words I'm loco
Six foot zero with my height, complexion cocoa
Representin on the mic it seems to be my daily
I can do a split and turn around like Alvin Ailey
But when it comes to days like this I got lyrics to go
 I's like that y'all, c'mon y'all
Lyrics to go I's like that y'all, c'mon y'all
 I's like that
 I know it's been two years but see the Tribe was never fallin
Would have tried for singin but that stuff was not my callin
The mic is in effect so you know I'm never stallin
Walkin through the door and all them suckers started haulin
Talk a lot of trash but no one can seem to beat it
Pull out your microphone and watch the Phifer make you eat it
The MC's they get jealy when the girly's on my belly
Kick a slow dance like my brother R. Kelly 
Today's a hip-hop draft will I be top-seeded? 
Worked too frickin hard while all the rest were gettin weeded
Steady kickin styles so I can reach that other level 
Don't worry about gettin gassed I push the pedal to the metal
Always wanted this cause it surely beats a scramble 
I'm Jordan with the mic, huh, wanna gamble? 
This I dedicate to all the honeys that be bogle-in
Cause at the end of the night y'know Malik will have his Trojans
But when it comes to nights like this I got lyrics to go
Check it out y'all
 I's like that y'all
Lyrics to go Check it out y'all
 I's like that y'all
Lyrics to go Check it out y'all
 I's like that y'all
Lyrics to go Check it out y'all
 I's like that y'all
I's like that y'all
Check it out y'all
I's like that y'all
Check it out y'all
I's like that y'all
Check it out here we go! 
Please proceed with caution cause the lyricist is fatal
I can kick your little monkey ass like Kato 
Formulate your rhymes like a child forms Play-Doh 
Calm and serene like the study was Tao
Poetry machine with correct mechanisms
Immune to disease I defeat organisms
That are waitin in my path, I overstep the critters
Give your ass the willies and your moms'll get the jitters
Quitters turn to losers, losers are forgotten
Tangling my cord with hopes that I’ll stop rockin
Never will that happen only if it is permitted 
Wait... I think somebody shitted 
I guess that will be me cause I'm the only one MCin
I go for what I know doin a show for human beings
Always try to lead yo never will I follow
Blowin up the spot like Fred did to Rollo
And when it comes to days like this, I got lyrics to go
Check it out y'all
 I's like that y'all
I got lyrics to go Everybody
 Ah c'mon now
I got lyrics to go Ah check it out y'all
 I's like that now
I got lyrics to go Everybody
 Ah c'mon now
I got lyrics to go Check it out y'all
 I's like that now
I got lyrics to go C'mon y'all
 Everybody
I got lyrics to go I's like that y'all
 Check it out now
I got lyrics to go Ah c'mon y'all
 Everybody
I got lyrics to go I's like that y'all
 Check it out now
I got lyrics to go I's like that y'all
 Every-bo-ty
I got lyrics to go I's like that y'all
 Ah check it out now
I's like that y'all
Check it now
I's like that y'all
Check it now
It goes... uhh
Oh my God! 
There's a million MCs that claim they want some
But see I create sounds that make your ears go numb
Peace to Sayres Ave., yeah you know how we go
My best friend Steven at the Home Depot
Laurelton is in the house, I can't forget Southside
Walk past MCs like that girl did to Pharcyde
I'm labeled as the cat's meow, the MC with the know-how
Act like you know, not now but right now
Beast of the East, on MCs I have a feast
I'd eat that ass like quiche, crack a smile like Shanice
Straight outta Jamaica, seen? Jamaica, Queens
But you could find me out in Georgia, or anywhere in between
Now if my partners don't look good, Malik won't look good
If Malik don't look good, then Quest won't look good
If the Quest don't look good, then Queens won't look good
But since the sounds are universal, New York won't look good
Picture Phife losing a battle, come on, get off it
Put down the microphone son, surrender, forfeit
Did I hear something'bout a crew? What they wanna do? 
You better call Mr. Babyface so he can bring out the cool in you
Or it'll be a sad love song being sung by Toni Braxton
And I'll dissect you like a fraction
Oh, you wannabe top cat MCs, I'll pop you like a zit
You wanna be the champ, you more like Chief Some-shit
Big up myself every time when it comes to this
MCs be running scared as if they're watching the Exorcist
I kick more game than a crackhead from Hempstead
My styles are milk, man, you'd think that I was breast-fed
You know the steelo when the diggy Dawg is on the scene
I dedicate this to all the MCs outta Queens
That goes for Onyx, LL, Run DMC
Akinyele, Nasty Nas and the Extra P
You need a chart, straight up and down man, there ain't no other
Nuff respect to all my peeps that made the album cover
Yo, Tip don't worry none you know I get the party jumping
Get on the mic and break'em off a little little something
Yo, Tip don't worry none you know I gets the party jumping
Get on the mic my man and break'em off a little something
We got the funk doody don shit, clearly it's the bomb shit
So recognize me, kids memorize me
Everyday, I be scrounging, really I be lounging
I play the down low, very very incognito
Aries is my sign, I know that I can rhyme
Sometimes I rhyme in riddles, plus I make the honeys wiggle
Intellect is the major, some heads like to wager
The skills on the hill, overlooking dollar bills
Man, you're crazy, thinking you can phase me
The Ab doesn't study mere nonsense, money
Life seems to need me, MCs seem too cheesy
With their doody ass renditions of defeating competition
I rock to the roll man, yes, I'm a soul man
Bet your bottom dollar Vinia will make you holler
As you stand at attention, did I forget to mention
MCs will give me twenty if I sense that they act funny
Lyrics are abundant, right there, I sound redundant
Just mentioning the fact that the area is fat
I dwell in the under, so honey it's no wonder
That I get plenty of tail, well I even get white
I'mma bet hitting head crack, there money, take that
Breaking niggas off, cut their bank, then I'm off
While my Nikes match my Lo hat, beat joint is mad fat
Got the cutter of the box if a kid think he's ox
For tier means creator, the poetry relator
I's hemmed like Betsy Ross, let me tell you who's the boss
Queens got a...
Brooklyn got a...
Bronx got a...
Staten Island got a...
Long Island got the zone
Jersey got a...
Philly got a...
Milwaukee got a...
L.A. got a...
Oaktown got the zon
Ayo, put one up for the Phifer, long time no hear from
Suckers walkin' around talking about they could get some
But that vibe is non cypher, no can do
And if you take I fi' joke, then ask the other two
And I proceed to let you know, exactly how to flow
I'm not Lawn Doctor so just seckle with the hoe
Oops...my mistake, I didn't know you went with her
Should I run down the line of all the kids that done hit her? 
Don't be bitter, I hear that honey resembles a critter
Heard she likes the two-on-one like my man John Ritter
But back to the subject, you can't catch wreck
You must get respect, to earn respect
Suckers think they could hurt me,'cause now I wear specs
You're full of jokes, but yo, your name ain't Flex
I got the riches, the bitches, I'm large like a Huxtable
You think you're all that, but your girl's quite doable! 
Yeah, I'm tellin' you G, to back up off me
I’m not a man called Hawk, but I ain’t Mr. Softee
Rappin' is an art, coming straight from the heart
So forget the chart because the action can start
Ha...where ya at? To all my peoples with the funk
I'm the undercover brother, dump your hoe in the trunk
Save all the sad songs and the tearjerkers
Niggas step back, it's the lyrical worker
The poems that I create ain't in paperback books
The poems that I create are for hookers and the crooks
My mental is excelling'cause I dabble in the books
I'm not the one to front on, so suboops-suboops
Yo, I gets the pickin's, I'm such a damn Dickens
If you step to this then the plot just thickens
I'll run you around the track like a bunny and a dog
To me, your just another MC on the log
A link in the chain, fluid on the brain
I boast of hype lyrics, and yours are mundane
See, I can't maintain, especially if you come back
I'm the lyrical master blaster, yeah, I could do that
I could also do your girl, so leave the hoe at home
'Cause when I get done, I'll have her strung on bones
I's the no-joke pressure, that elevates my mind
Make me pick up and go when it's time to drop my rhymes
My title is rock, the Abstract Poetic
I'm in the idle mode but my energy's kinetic
So smooth and debonair, special for the ear
Gotta keep my thing in gear
'Cause it's evident and clear that I will rock, rock, rock...
The motherfucking saga continues
All hail to those believin in the real gangsta shit
Cause when it comes to the real niggas
It makes the shit that much harder to deal with
Yeah, Above The Law up in this motherfucker
Black Mafia for life
Down with the real niggas for life! Ha ha
Yo Sweet Talk, tell'em what the fuck we here for! 
Well alright y'all, USC, Compton, Watts
The Woods! All across the motherfuckin USA
Ye though I walk through the the valley of real niggas
I should fear no man or motherfuckin Klan, hear me one
Cause I been to the mountaintops, y'all
And I done seen through the eyes of a real nigga
Yo, they make some of the coooooooolest shit I done never heard! 
Yo, for me Km.G I must give it up
To the Ruthless motherfuckin gangsters
Fear no mob! 
Because you're scared mon, you're scared! 
Dem de pussy runnin at y'all scared mon
Bend dem silly bumba claat barber'til de pussy claat run
BO! BO! BO! BO! BO! Keep Baby-lon on the run, seen! 
The real niggas is back, cause there's too many bullshit records out
Niggas fiendin for what we put out
But you don't have to wait no longer
Because the new album is out and the shit is much stronger
So many groups made three albums or more
And that weak-ass shit is still sittin in the record store
They wonder why it never sold
Niggas rappin since the 70's and still never went gold
Our first record sold two million copies
That's because you other motherfuckers are sloppy
You came out street and crossed over
And after that your career is fuckin over
Because of that you're not around
So shut the fuck up and witness the sound of some real niggas
Yeah, motherfuckers! 
Keepin' all you busters on the run in'91
Kick that shit, Ren
Most niggas can't understand
And never will if they ain't part of the Ruthless mafia clan
Niggas is dedicated to the streets
With hype fuckin lyrics and the dope-ass beats
The songs will never come soft, because I come off
So don't get in my way cause motherfucker you'll get cut off
And it's somethin you can move your lips to
To wrap around my dick and suck if it fits you
And let me now if you wanna ride the D-I-C-K
All day that's with no play
Cause ain't no rap group out that I know
That make me wanna listen to the radio
All I hear is motherfuckers tryin to make a comeback
With lovesongs, and that shit is wack
And that's why your ass ain't around
Cause you don't have the motherfuckin sound
Of a real nigga
Die nigga! We are born to die nigga
You've been dyin for 400 years
Niggas know how to die
Niggas don't know nothin else, but dying
Niggas dream about dying
I'm a motherfuckin nigga  
I'm a motherfuckin nigga  
I'm a motherfuckin nigga  
I'm a motherfuckin nigga  
I got a case, of spittin in a motherfucker's face
So me and my ace, we got a taste
Of a motherfucker's billy club, he took his gun and
Put it to my head and said, 
Nigga start runnin
So tell me what's the next episode? 
Is he crazy, does he want to chase me or waste me? 
I thought, 
Run nigga run, but I caught myself
Because my secondary thought was death
I've got head and heart real, but still a motherfucker said
I want another black motherfucker dead
Niggas ain't good for shit to me
Cause it's a race for second class, so get your ass
Up against the wall bitch, and then he tried
To jump me but the punk became a victim of a walkby
Fuckin with Dre, you get a foot up in your asshole
I's just another way to let you know
Nigga send them, nigga send them, nigga send them
Punk can't fuck with me - Real motherfucking G
Straight from the streets of the CPT
Telling you why, real niggas don't die
I-iiiiiii, just want to celebrate! 
Real niggas don't die cause they eventually multiply
The niggas I'm with, they take an eye for an eye
Because the times are so wrong, gotta stay so strong
Niggas gotta keep it goin on and on
And don't let no paleface throw your ass in a snail race
Have your residence occupyin a jail space
That's what they want to do cause the system is fucked around
I try to let you know with the records that's underground
They don't give a fuck about a nigga, they would rather pull the trigger
And have you in front of a barrel smilin sayin 
Cheese! 
So nigga get smart and rebel back
I'm not with that black shit so I'm not gonna yell that
All I see is niggas getting harassed
And can't do nothin about it but get a foot in they ass, yo
But if every nigga grabbed a nine
And started shootin motherfuckers it would put'em in line
And that's how it's supposed to be
When a pussy-ass nigga try to fuck with me
Yo, because it's useless to try
To kill a nigga cause nigga a motherfuckin real nigga don't die! 
I-iiiiiii, just want to celebrate! 
Die nigga, everywhere you go
Niggas dying, niggas been dyin for 400 years
I'm a motherfuckin nigga  
Only the good die young, so that makes me young and bad
Puttin ass-kickings on the niggas that never had
So I guess that makes me tough shit
Straight up gangsta, wrong nigga to fuck with
So how can a nigga die, when he's causin the bloodshed
By shoot motherfuckers in the head
Tryin to make a nigga extinct because they fear me
But never wanna hear me
So I'mma let'em know how a nigga's livin
Takin from motherfuckers cause nobody ain't givin
A damn thang! To a nigga, a real nigga
So I'm living by the motherfuckin trigger
Cause a nigga ain't afraid of bein locked up
I'm out of luck, so why should I give a fuck? 
But they still want to try
To kill a nigga like me but motherfuckin real niggas don't die! 
I-iiiiiii, just want to celebrate! 
Yeah, a real nigga don't die! 
Yeah motherfuckers! 
Why you brothers insist on usin' the word nigga? 
Don't you know that's bringin' down the black race? 
Nigga nigga nigga that's all I hear you motherfuckers talk about is nigga
You can do what you want, just keep it out of my neighborhood
Personally I think the lyrics are a bit too harsh
I ain't no nigga, fuck that shit
Does everything come out your mouth got to be a 4-letter word? 
All over this bullshit, it's just a bunch of fuckin' noise
The way you talk about women is bullshit, plain bullshit
What you motherfuckers doin' for the black community anyway? 
Motherfucker I got kids, I don't want'em listenin' to that bullshit
*hospital monitor starts beeping*
Fuck the niggas! 
Motherfuckers need to stop
How can you call yourself a nigga and be proud of it? 
*monitor stops beeping - R.I.P.*
 Flatline
 Bullshit! 
 Why do I call myself a nigga you ask me? 
Well it's because motherfuckers wanna blast me
And run me outta my neighborhood
And label me as a dope dealer yo, and say that I'm no good
But I gave out jobs so niggas wouldn't have to go out
Gave em some dope and a corner so they could show out
When the cops came, they gave a fake name
Because the life in the streets is just a head game
So therefore, to make more
A 15-year-old black kid'll go and rob a liquor store
And get shot in the process
He ate up a nine bullet and now he's put to rest
Why do I call myself a nigga you ask me? 
I guess it's just the way shit has to be
Back when I was young gettin' a job was murder
Fuck flippin burgers, cause I deserve a
Nine-to-five I can be proud of, that I can speak loud of
And to help a nigga get out of
Yo! The concrete playground
But most motherfuckers only want you to stay down
But I'm a smart motherfucker you see
One of the best producers in the rap music industry
Gettin' paid like a motherfucker
A young brother, who don't give a fuck about another
Yeah
Why do I call myself a nigga you ask me? 
Because police always wanna harass me
Every time that I'm rollin
They swear up and down that the car was stolen
Make me get face down in the street
And throw the shit out my car on the concrete
In front of a residence
A million white motherfuckers on my back like I shot the President
Why do I call myself a nigga you ask me? 
Because my mouth is so motherfuckin nasty
Bitch this, bitch that, nigga this, nigga that
In the mean while my pockets are gettin' fat
Gettin paid to say this shit here
Makin' more in a week than a doctor makes in a year
So why not call myself a nigga? 
I's better than pullin' the trigger and goin' up the river
And then I get called a nigga anyway
Broke as a motherfucker and locked away, so
So cut out all that bullshit
Yo! I guess I'll be a nigga for life
Nigga nigga nigga nigga nigga nigga, please
I'm treated like a fuckin disease
You say - why do I call myself a nigga so quick? 
Cause I can reach in my drawers and pull out a bigger dick, yo
Nigga say nigga we cool but
Cracker say nigga, nigga knocked the fuck up
But I gotta be a fast nigga, to never be the last nigga
Or I'll have to beat yo' ass, nigga
In the city you see action first
Then hear about it later in a verse I curse
Because I'm real with this to keep my shit straight bumpin
Murder, created by the streets of Compton
Now get it from the underground poet
I live it, I see it, and I write it because I know it
And if you think I'm fuckin your wife
You're motherfuckin right yo, cause I'm a nigga for life
I love niggas, I love niggas, I love niggas
Because niggas are me
And I should only love that which is me
I love that you niggas 
Nigga this, nigga that
The actual fact is that I'm black and bound to attract
The attention of another, I mean the other
But I'm a motherfucker that'll have'em runnin' for cover
You see, I don't give a fuck about nothin
Except gettin' paid, gettin' bitches, and issuin' stitches
Which is, all needed to read it and find a rhyme
And then it's time to say, the nigga's here to stay
But what about the fake niggas, the house niggas
To get paid quick they gotta suck a fat dick
But N.W.A. is outta your motherfuckin' range
We ain't gonna change a motherfuckin' thang! 
I call myself a nigga cause my skin won't lighten
I call myself a nigga cause the shit that I'm writin
Hypes me, hypes other motherfuckers around me
And that's the reason why they wanna surround me
And ask me - why do I call myself a negro? 
Ain't none of their fuckin business cause I'll let the trigger go
So get out my presence and get out of my sight
Cause MC Ren is a nigga for life
You're a nigga'til you die
If you're a po' nigga, you're a po' nigga
If you're a rich nigga, you're a rich nigga
But you never stop bein a nigga
And if you get to be educated you just an educated nigga
I's plain to see, you can't change me
Cause I'mma be a nigga for life
*static noise*
I'm a nigga, he's a nigga, she's a nigga, we some niggas
Wouldn't you like to be a nigga too?
Hi! 
 
... and it gets excited! 
... balance and illustration
And that's tomorrow's forecast. Back to you Jim
Thanks, Dick! Now have a man, Hale Anderson LIVE at the arena for tonight's N.W.A
Concert. What's goin' on down there, Hale? 
No more NWA! 
Well, Jim the riders has getting pretty round a here
I think we will has some fights here, and here the authorities coming on their way because they appears to me...
Some people in black has standin' on the roof...
I hear gunshots! ! 
There Please, stop! Stop! 
There they go! Oh, wait, wait! 
Take the fuckin' camera on!'Ey, Hart, stop! 
STOP THE FUCKI' CAMERA! 
I MEAN, HELP! 
SHUT THAT, SHUT THAT SHIT OFF! 
FUCK! CHARLES, TURN THE FUCKI' CAMERA OFF, YOU MOTHAFUCKA... 
Hahahahahahaha!
I got a taste for waste and a taste and a blood
Murder I heard her when she screamed the 
Drop! 
'Cause her son caught the slug
Relate this to no choice
And listen to this straight-up man before they ban the voice
While I rhyme to the rhythm of a pop
Remember the first nigga that runs is the first to get shot
Whoever said that what I say and portray is negativity
Need to come kick it in the city with me
And find the black and crack de fact
And take that shit back
'Cause they don't wanna fuck with that
There's too many niggas they're tryin' to calm
If mothafuckaz could get it, nobody would've fuck with it
Appetite for destruction
For him to get a bit more shit he gotta commit
Murder in the first degree and manslaughter
Takin' the life of his wife and young daughter
A whole city of bitches that look sucked up
And the niggas is killin', it's straight fucked up
Whoever sayin' what I'm sayin is for greed
The 9 even when they're tryin' to feed
My appetite for destruction
You guys know who I'm talkin' to
The appetite is tremendous, so I'm gonna spin this
Drop up some violence because they ask me to end this
Some trouble that I cought'cause I was noisy
A nigga tried to take advantage because of the kamikaze
He took a swing for my head, thought I was faded
Start runnin' for the door but the fucker never made it
The sound of the 9 went bang
And all over the wall was his mothafuckin' brain
'Cause I'm a nigga you can't sleep on
So set the alarm,'cause I hit like a mothafuckin' bomb
I do damage with the 9 in my hand
But the average nigga that don’t know me don’t understand
I'm from the streets, so therefore
You know I don't care for a sucker that ain't down
With the real niggas, the niggas, the niggas
Yo, and after when the shit gotta go ain't even sober
Any time that the 9 wanna leave
I got a.38 hidden up the sleeve
And it's ready to go to war'cause that's what it's here for
I shoot down a million niggas and shoot one more
And that's the million and one, they couldn't hang with the appetite,'cause they wasn't rappin' right
So I had to destroy whoever was standin' in my presence
For fuckin' up the essence – appetite for destruction
Cops put a hurtin' on yo' ass, man
You know, they really degrade you
White folks don't believe that shit
They don't believe that cops degrade you
 Oh come on, those people, those people are resisting arrest.
 Check it out, y'all, in the house, y'all
So I can show and flow and let the people know
So won't you ease on down to the yellow brick road
To Compton, but first let me tell you somethin'
I possess the 10 commandments of the hip-hop thugsta
Known as the thief and murderer
First one – honor thy nigga with an attitude
Gotta get respect or break your mothafuckin' neck
Second one – always gotta fuck out of wedlock
I like it when the pussy goes snap, crackle and pop
Number three – I'm a gangsta fanatic
I smoke any fools tryna'cause some static
Number four – here's what's in store
A crazy-ass nigga that remains hardcore
Fifth one – my kill has just begun
I pull out my gun, that'll keep me on the run
Step six – hmmm, it's kinda tricky
Can't forget that I'm mothafuckin' chicken-shit
To the ones who tries to play the E
By the time you reach Seven you'll be six feet deep
Number eight – make no mistake
Move real sneaky and you're bound to catch your prey
Ninth one – I gotta be raw
Fuck any brainwashin' man-made law! 
Last but not least, I must be real
Number ten – is my appetite to ki–
Yo! Bitch, don't you know I'll beat your mother'...
Oh, oh! you
'Ey, what's happenin' everybody? 
I's your mayn nigga behind the mothafuckin' trigga, Willy Johnston! 
And I'm in front of the liquor store with all the bitches, thieves and dopeheads
And I got my man Edmond Woodrow Jones
Aaand the Johntson Sisters
No Relation
So then put little something together, .. to tell y'all... what's really goin' on! 
Mia put this shit on! 
Oooooooooooooohhhhhhhhhhhhhhh! 
Oooooooooooooohhhhhhhhhhhhhhh! 
Oooooooooooooohhhhhhhhhhhhhhh...
Du-dum, dum-dum! 
Doooon't drink that wiiiine
Coke would be better, just - it's easy to fiiiind! 
If that won't do, - smoke a joint o-or twoo-ooo! 
Don't drink that wii-iii-iine! - Woooaahhh, that wii-ii-iine! 
The shit y'all listenin' to was sponsored by 
M.A.D.D
Mothafuckas Against Drunk Drivin'! 
: when you talkin motherfuckin hit
Daaaamn, this some good shit, man! 
Where you get this shit from? Daaamn! 
Yeah, now we take it back to an earlier...
The...
The previous program!
Ninteen-ninety-mothafucking-one
N.W.A back in this mothafucker, yo
Takin' out all you commercialized-ass niggas
And we're on this laid back track
And we're doin' this one kinda smooth
So whatcha gonna do, Dre? - Kick it! 
And so on, let the shit flow on
Because I need somethin' to go off on
The mothafuckin' D-R-E servin' a death wish
So I'mma hit you like this
Early in the morning, hop into the B-en-z
I got 44 ways of gettin' paid
Sittin' in my lap as I roll off the Compton blocks
To scoop up Ren, I heard shots
1, 2, 3, then I seen a nigga
Hoppin' the fence and it was Ren on the mothafuckin' trigger
He got in the Benz and said
Dre, I was speakin' to yo' bitch O'Shea”
And as we roll on, I seen the patroller creep
So we got ghost before they peeped
Me and Ren in a black CE, yo
Bumpin' some funky shit by the D.O.C
I gotta get paid, paid in a hurry, see
I got a habit if I'm not paid thoroughly
I start takin', makin' sure my shit is steady bumpin'
A nigga always into somethin'
Ba-ba-ba-ba! Fuck the mothafuckin' police cause they push that black man down and they kick him in his mothafuckin' balls. Goddamn police, fuck them! Come down, MC Ren
I heard a dope beat, somebody told me that Buck did it
But if Dre didn't do it I can't fuck with it
N.W.A is like a mix a fix a trix
Real niggas with big dicks
You're takin' a chance when you think that
Talkin' under your breath won't lead to young death
Fuckin' up shit, ain’t shit but a killin'
For a nigga labeled as bein' a mothafuckin' villain
But you don't know me, a record can't tell ya
How so many prayed I'd be a mothafuckin' failure
Real niggas gotta have top rankin'
I hooked up with three more niggas and started makin'
Funky-ass shit for your system
Might sound nice so it makes you wanna listen to a
Sample of a ruthless organization
But you don't want a confrontation
Real niggas don't play
Yella, Eazy, me, and the nigga nigga Dre
Yo, always makin' sure that my shit is steady bumpin'
A nigga always into somethin'
Boom-boom! Look at that bitch walking down the mothafuckin' street
Now she know the Admiral wanna hold my dick in
Because that bitch’s booty is so na-na-na-na-na-na-nasty
Yeah, the world's most dangerous group
Definitely in this mothafucka
Sendin' a shout-out to all the bitches out there
Yo, you can get the pick up to suck a dick up'til you hiccup
You know what I'm sayin'
Yo, cause I'm a nigga for life
And I really don't give a fuck
I'm goin' for mine, every time
I see a fuckin' softy, punk strong as coffee
A nigga like that best to back up off me
Yo, cause these are the days and the times of the real niggas
False niggas, end up as tossed niggas
And that's on the real, cause I'm a nigga that kills
Again and again, so tell'em what's up Ren
If I'm not into nothin', I don't feel right
So I grab the nine and the clip and go and murder mothafuckas at night
Because I'm startin' to fiend, from sittin' in a cell
Where the crime was too tragic I couldn't make bail
So now they gotta hold me
And listen to rehabilitation over and over, sayin' they told me
But I don't give a fuck cuz I know my shit is pumpin'
A nigga always into somethin'
1991 and N.W.A get the job done
Admiral Dancehall gonna tell a story'bout a girl that's quick fi lick me dick, it goes something like this....

Because me singin' on the NWA album
That’s why me singin' up on the NWA has brung-a
A message to Benedict Arnold
No matter how hard you try to be...
Here's what they think about you! 
Hello? I was at The Celebrity... and I was wonderin' how that punk Ice Cube got his ass beat by ATL! 
Yo! Dat nigga was sayin' he from Compton, he ain't from Compton
He from a planet called: 
Punk!  It is full of pussy protein and pearl tounge
All I wanna know is why y'all let his punk-ass in the group in the first place, when you knew what kinda bitch he was? 
Yeah, I was in the New Music Seminar in New York! 
And I watched that punk muthafucka run... while the rest of his homeboys got they ass beat! 
Hello? I'm callin' to say since Ice Cube was suckin' so much New York dick...can he come and eat sum of this Chicago pussy? 
I smell...PUSSY! 
Yeah, nigga; when we see yo' ass, we gon' cut your hair off and fuck you with' a broomstick! 
Think about it, punk muthafucka!
Prisoner like a hostage
Yo, you should've covered your muthafucking head like an ostrich
Deep in the dirt cause you's a sucker
Bend ya ass up high so I can kick the muthafucker
Don't try to hang, you best avoid
Cause my foot will be so far up you ass, you'll get hemorrhoids
Before you try to fuck wit Ren
I'll put two in your ass and you'll be shitting a size 10
First come, first serve, whoever's got the nerve
Step up and get what you deserve
From the word of a muthafucking hip-hop maniac
Brainiac, so what you oughta do is step the fuck back
Now how the fuck you think that rap would last
Wit your ass saying shit that is said in the past
Yo, be original, your shit is sloppy
Get off the dick you muthafucking carbon copy
Falling deep in the drums of so many of styles
Is one of the reasons a nigga ran a hundred miles
Cheating and not beating, the crowd I kept seating
But weak muthafuckas biting off and they kept eating
Styles that kept them full of bull
Cause the vocals were local in nightclubs and not getting paid in full
They got the nerve to cuss
Only reason niggas pick up your record is cause they thought it was us
Yo, giving what I gotta give, doing what I gotta do
You don't care for me, so who gives a fuck about you
You can't harm me, alarm me
Cause we're the generals in this fucking hip-hop army
The niggas wit attitudes if you didn't know
We blow, flow and getting loose slow from the get go, yo
Titles are takin'
Yo, fuck this shit, Yella, kick the break in
I's the real thing
You are now
Real, real niggas, niggas
You can run but you can't hide, you know I'm a find ya
Cause a nigga like Ren's only two steps behind ya
Don't look back, cause you're shaking and all scared
A nigga in black can be your scariest nightmare
So sleep wit the lights on, forget that the mic's on
Don't step on my muthafucking stage without Nike's on
Don't say it's psycho and then you just might go
Mentally fucked up when I let the right blow
All these niggas with the jibber jabber
But couldn't kill a fly wit a muthafucking sledge hammer
Gangstas in black are out there
But only because, yo, it's the shit we wear
On my muthafucking dick
But I'm a love it when you drop like a muthafucking brick
So, yo, step off, go to bed, cause if you're mislead
You get a muthafucking bullet in your forehead
Back, the good, the bad, the ugly, you see
A little streetwise nigga, you know me
Rolling wit some real niggas playing for keeps
But you muthafuckas know who run the streets
With that hardcore hip-hop rap shit
Now how much harder can another nigga get? 
Trying to be like us, sound like us, dress like us
Ashes to ashes and dust to dust
So nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga, please
Since you're on the dick why don't you drop to your knees
Cause I'm a muthafucka that's out to kill
Eazy-E, a nigga that's real
Real niggas, straight off the streets of Compton
Quick to get in your shit without second thought
And if your ass get smoked, it's my bullet you caught
So if you're talking shit about the niggas in black
Bow down to the Kings in Raider hats
They played out, that's what niggas were chanting
One nigga left and they said we ain't have in it
People had thought we was finished and then done wit
But if you think about it, yo, we really ain't done shit
Yet, so cover your ears and wipe your tears
And quit sniffing all over my dick for new ideas
And when the new record come, I'll come like a fucking bomb
Asking for fucking money, don't buy you a fucking crumb
You're on the dicks of four niggas not one
And when it comes to dicks, you don't even have one
So brace yourself to make sure you don't get fucked up
Because if I let you slide, it's just cause you lucked up
Don't come in my face again, because I'm a floor ya
And if you're a bitch, I'm a fucking ignore ya
Because my attitude's a little bigga
Cause MC Ren is one of the real niggas
Lost in a muthafucking world of madness
Sadness, but Dre is just a nigga that glad its
Sucking muthafuckas like you, making wack jams
Because it only shows you how dope I am
Never try to ignore us
When I'm expressing, stand still like you're full of rigor mortis
Cause I'm a real nigga, but I guess you figure
You can break me, take me, but watch me pull the trigger
Dre is just a nigga with heart, a nigga that's smart
A nigga that's paid to say what others are scared to play
We started out wit too much cargo
So I'm glad we got rid of Benedict Arnold
Yo, N.W.A - criticized for what we say
But I'm a do this shit anyway
Cause I'm the muthafucking doctor, never faking
Yo, Yella, kick the muthafucking break in
I's the real thing
You are now
Real, real niggas, niggas
Yeah, motherfucker, it's the real thing
You are now
Real, real niggas, niggas
N.W.A, straight outta muthafucking Compton
Taking over shit in all of the 1990's
Yo, Dr. Dre, DJ Yella, Eazy-E
And I am MC Ren, yo, N.W.A taking over this muthafucka y'all
The world's most dangerous group
Once again beating on your motherfucking eardrums
Doing much damage for all you slutty ass ho's
Yo, there was a bitch I knew on the avenue
She was good to G-O for a nut or two yo
I think her name was Clara
And she was guaranteed to give a motherfucka whatever he needs
To be perfectly honest, she was a hooker
So I took her a hundred yards, to the boulevard
I told her 
I'll take care of you, you take care of me
You've got a P-I-M-P and all I want is the money
She went to work and the niggas were fiendin'
Yo, she had the biggest ass that you ever seen
In fact she was like Medusa, with titties full grown
One look and your dick turns to stone, yeah
Keepin' in mind that she was the kind that would find the time to get mine
Because she knows I'm not to be fucked with
She ain't crazy
Fuckin' with Dre, she'll be pushin' up daisies
She was the perfect ho, but wouldn't you know
The bitch tried to gank me, so
I had to kill her
Yeah, straight hittin'
Now listen up and lemme tell you how I did it
Yo, I tied her to the bed, I was thinking the worst
But yo, I had to let my niggas fuck her first yeah
Loaded up the forty-fo', yo
Then I straight smoked the ho
Cause I'm a real nigga, but I guess you figure
I was soft and she thank me
Coughed to the boss and got tossed
One less bitch you gotta worry about
She's outta here and that's how it turns out
Now Vicky Vicky Vicky, she's very tricky
She put her hickey on top of my dick, sick betsy
She told me she loved me and she wanted to keep me
If only she can have the dick with me
I said I'm with it but baby you gotta hold up
If I was happy with somethin' that I could fold up
We can do this - she said her husband was rich
Then I knew I had the bitch
Yo she wrote a check, many a check
In the name of a bitch who was strugglin' at the same game
All I wanted to do was get P-A-I-D
Just a little somethin' for fuckin' me
Yo Everything was cool but Vicky concerned me
Her husband was the District Attorney
So, before he found out he was crossed up
By his bitch I was fuckin' I had her tossed up
And put to sleep, so a nigga never forgets
A dead bitch can't tell a nigga shit
One less bitch you gotta worry about
She's outta here and that's how it turned out
One less
One less
One less bitch you gotta worry about! 
Thinkin' about money, and lookin' at a prostitute
The bitch was cute, so now I had to execute
And shoot game like a real nigga
With a steel trigga
Convince her to move up to somethin' bigga
I think I had a flashback though
Cause I said fuck it
Loped and choked and smoked to the ho' like this:
Bitch, it's all about Dre
The money, money, money and this all I gotta say
Of course she came with me and remained with me
'Till the bitch felt lamed and ashamed to be
Workin' that trick shit
Cause niggas knew that she was short one
A little later though she called one
In the chest and I knew that it was commin'
By who and how the all act would be done? 
So what? One less bitch I gotta worry about
But that ain't how it turned out..
Yo, there was a bitch named her out and shot her
Straight to the muthafuckin' trigger and said 
I got her! 
But I had better plans to give her the blues
Like dumpin' her in the river with cement shoes
I knew my money was comin' up short
And the thought that the stupid bitch thought she'd never get caught
Came home early and straight bust her ass
On the couch with her other nigga countin' my cash
I should've known she was like them other hoes
I told the two motherfuckaz to take off their clothes
Butt naked, nothin' left but the shoes
I had up a nine so they couldn't refuse
I shot the nigga, he was outta there
And tied up the bitch to the motherfuckin' chair
Now there's one less bitch I gotta worry about
Everybody out, that's how it turns out
One less
One less
One less bitch you gotta worry about! 
In reality, a fool is one who believes that all women are ladies
A nigga is one who believes that all ladies are bitches
And all bitches are created equal
To me, all bitches are the same
Money-hungry, scandalous groupie hoes
That's always ridin' on a nigga's dick, always in a nigga's pocket
And when the nigga runs out of money the bitch is gone in the wind
To me, ALL BITCHES AI'T SHIT! 
One less
One less
One less bitch you gotta worry about!
Hehehehehehehahahahaha
Yeah, it's me again
So check it out - ladies, not gentlemen
Drop your draws, cop a seat
And let's get into this, yeah
Easily I'm approachin', there ain't no jokin'
When the pussy holes are open
Ready to fuck until my dick is raw
Yo! the muthafuckin' devil's son-in-law
No it's the E, the mothafuckin' pussy-beater
And I’m the quicker-picker-up, I'm quick to pick up a bitch
So come here bitch and lick up and lick up and lick up the dick
Now how many nuts would it take for me
To let that bitch graduate to lesson three, let's see
As you can see I straight waxed that ass
Back up bitch unless you want nut in your eye
I never never ever ever seen a bitch cry
Nut one, nut two, nut four, five, six
I lost the third nut in the mix, fuck it! 
Six, five, four, now three is up
Gimme that gimme that gimme that nut
You wanna feel the dick baby try your luck
Because the E likes to fuck fuck fuck yo
I get'em stuck-on and get the fuck on
Give'em a Tootsie Roll and tell'em thanks for the pussy hole
I find'em fuck'em and flee you know
But before I D.O. - yo I take a ho to the hotel
To the motel, to the holiday inn
Yo, if that bitch start fuckin' up 
I'll just fuck her friend
Ah Dr. Dre
What up? 
My mellow
Yo
I's on you - so what the fuck you're gonna do? 
Well, it's on and on and on and on
Yo the beat don't stoppin''till the break o' dawn
Yo, every bitch I know they wanna get with me
The motherfuckin' notorious D-R-E
Spit game at a bitch while a nigga's around
And you know most ho's knows not to clown
Cause if a bitch tries to diss me while I'm full of liquor
I smack the bitch up and shoot the nigga that's with her
That's the kind of nigga that you're listenin' to
Talk to you for a minute then my dick's in you
Yo now every single bitch got a price to pay
Up on the dicks of N.W.A
I find'em fuck'em and flee you know
But before I D.O. - yo, I take a hoe to the hotel
To the motel, to the holiday inn 
If that bitch start fuckin' up, yo
I'll just fuck her friend
Now MC Ren
What up? 
My mellow
A check it out
I's on you - so what the fuck you're gonna do? 
Now gather around y'all, and check it out y'all
And all the bitches come and suck up on my balls y'all
And take a ticket to play with it like a Slinky
So put your lips on my big chocolate twinkie
And you swallow all the nut if you bitches are smart
To make my dick pop up like a Pop-Tart
But after I nut I'mma leave ya
But first I must deceive ya, because bitch I don't need ya
And don't say that you love me too
Cause if I turn my back you would fuck the whole crew
You're nothin' but a stank ho' tryin' to take my bank ho'
So I have to let you know  at a hotel
And a motel and a holiday inn 
Because if that bitch starts fuckin' up yo
I'll just fuck her friend
Yo Dre man, I take this bitch out to the movies and shit
Man we're kissin' and grindin' and shit
So we hop in the back seat
You know man, this bitch rubbin' all over my dick
And frontin' like she's gonna give me the pussy, man
And the bitch said 3 words, man: 
Stop, 
No, and 
Don't
I said biiiiiitch
You don't have to front on me dear
So why don't you just give that pussy here? 
If you'd be good to me
Ohh I'll be good to you
And we'll both ride home in my automobile
All that I want is a little puss'
All that I want is just a little head
If you'd be good to me
Ohh I'll be good to you
And we'll both ride home in my automobile
You don't have to front on me bitch
Don't be afraid - it's only a dick
Give up the pussy soon
All I want is a little womb
Or get your groupie ass out my hotel room
Or get your groupie ass out my hotel room
All I want is the pussy
All I want is the pussy
All I want is the pussy
All I want is the pussy
If you'd be good to me
Ohh I'll be good to you
And we'll both ride home in my automobile
We'll both ride home in my automobile
Lesson 2 : Gently place the balls into the mouth and
Hmmmmmmmmm..
Get it all baby
Get it all baby
Get it all baby
Don't matter just don't bite it
Suck this dick for daddy
Juicin' at the lips
I's the world's biggest dick
Don't matter just don't bite it
Slow is the tempo - now talkin' but a nympho
So peep it out here goes the info
This is a bitch that did the whole crew
She get it so much we make bets on who the ho would love to go through
And for the shit that she does, give her a drum roll
Because the dumb bitch licks out the asshole
And she'll let you videotape her
And if you got a gang of niggas, the bitch would let you rape her
She likes suckin' on dicks, and lickin' up nut
And they even take the broomstick up the butt
Just to say that she did it with a rapper
But the pussy was more fishy than red snapper
But how many licks would it take,  she asks
To make MC Ren start gooshin' up vanilla shakes? 
She took her tongue out her mouth, put it on top
Like a cherry, started movin' it like a snake and it was very irresistable
I couldn't pay the bitch to quit
Cuz the ho' was doin' some ol' crazy shit
That made me start havin' a fit'
Cuz the bitch sucked a hellified dick 
Now one night I was at a drive-in
And a car full of niggas straight drove in
I thought they wuz commin' to start trouble but no
Five niggas in the bucket with the neighborhood ho'
Now what do you expect they're gonna dogg her like a doggy
Thirty minutes later and the windowz all were foggy
And I'm off in my car havin' a fit cuz the bitch that I'm with
Said no fuckin' on the first date, shit
And I'm like Damn! I wish I was in the bucket
To be the sixth nigga with the ho' and I can fuck it
So I told the bitch I was with that I'm goin' to the snack bar
And got the fuck out the car
Went to the bucket and I looked through the window
It was some niggas that I knew they let me in yo
And my turn was like next
I couldn't see her face, all I saw was her pussy and her chest
I wanted to see the face, I felt I oughtta
Peep over the seat, Oh shit! I's the preacher's daughter! 
And she's only 14 and a ho'
But the bitch sucks dick like a specialized pro
She looked at me, I was surprised
But wasn't passin' up the chance of my dick gettin' baptized
I told the bitch to do it quick
You little ho' hurry up and suck my dick! 
Now I'm a break it down with a fact
Since the last 
Just don't bite it girls don't know how to act
Sayin' that they never would suck a dick
But when they've tried it they couldn't quit
Cuz ninety percent of the bitches today they love that shit
And those are the main ones that say they don't do it
But MC Ren knows the bitches are used to it
So fellas, next time they try to tell a lie
That they never suck a dick, punch a bitch in the eye
And then the ho' will fall to the ground
Then you'll open up her mouth
Put your dick in and move the shit around
And she'll catch on and start doin' it on her own
Actin' like she's tryin' to suck the meat off a chicken bone
And then she won't let go
Because bitches suck nut out of a dick just like Drano
Get the last drop, unclogging the pipe
Then the stupid bitch is out doing that same shit the next night
Because she just can't quit
Cuz she's addicted, addicted, she's addicted, addicted
She's addicted to suck a good dick
Aaaah, this is one of them songs
You can kick back and smoke a joint to
And get real fucked up
I like to dedicate this one to all the lovely young ladies out there
Oh me? I'm Eazy E, alias A Hoe Taming Motherfucker
And I want all you ladies to know something...
I'd rather fuck with you all goddamn night
Cause your pussy's good
Now I'm fucking all your friends
Cause you ran your mouth like I knew you would
You were bragging to your friends
Saying 
Eazy E knows how to fuck
So bring your ass in here and give me some
So I can bust a nut 
I'd rather fuck you, yeah 
I'd rather fuck you, yeah 
I'd rather fuck with you
Cause I like the way you scream my name
I know you like this dick
Cause you enjoy the pleasure and pain
Now I'm riding on this pussy here
And I'm not gonna stop 
We can do it doggy style
And you can get on top 
Hook/Jewell
Whoo boy, I'd rather fuck with you, yeah 
I need you baby, whoo, I'd rather fuck you, I'd rather fuck with you
I'd rather fuck with you
Cause the other bitches wanna wine and dine 
I better hurry up and get this nut
Cause it's check-out time
She said she wanted me to eat the pussy
Well I think I'll pass 
So get your ass up you funky bitch
And wash your ass 
What you want, is an unexpected approach
That may delay a suspect's awareness, of your presence
Until you have a chance to assess
The situation, you are confronted
Approach to danger... don't move
 Drop the gun
You could've prevented a tragedy
You can approach, but the danger light is blinkin
A self-desctruct button is activated when I'm thinkin
This is a tribulation, the weak is judged
The prophecy was fulfilled, cause I never budge
I took up the tools, crucifixion was the extreme
They're seein doubles of me, but it wasn't a dream
One vision was of life, the other was death
And life didn't give a fuck if death took your last breath
So you burn in my pit that I call hell
Where you got sent, because your shit don't sell
My twenty-twenty was blurry from the smoke
Of the niggas that I burned and tormented but I didn't choke
I started doing them, I kept on doing them, two of them
Shoot them up until that nigga Ren was through with them
And my presence to the suckers was of a stranger
But fuck it, they can approach to the danger
If you can be seen, you can be hit
If you can be hit, you can be killed
Fatal approach to danger, just to remain a strangler
Out run, the shot of a gun when the game's up
Murder in the first degree, but it's worse to be
A dead motherfucker or a nigga in custody
With everybody thinkin of death
I kept workin, to be one of the last niggas left
So many people lookin for hope, they broke
Without checkin the fingerprints on a motherfucker's throat
A heart of steel can reveal the real nigga in me
So figure to see, the D-E-A-D
Bodies like a nigga straight walkin in a cemetary
So it's very necessary to carry
Ammunition for niggas wishin but they better take caution
Before Dre goes off
And starts killin motherfuckers just in order to change the
Anger for the real nigga when I approach to danger
Approach the motherfuckin danger
Final approach to danger, death, destruction around every corner
Another dead body and you wanna keep runnin
But even the rain turns black
All you can do is stay alert and try to stay out of the searchlight
No prison, nobody makes bail
Everybody gotta go but see it ain't no jail
Think about death, takin your last breath
Heart beatin like a motherfucker like it ain't no time left
With so many ways to stay up, I gotta get mine
Even though they wanna make a crime, yo
Of bein real, a federal letter in the beginnin
Because of the release of 
Fuck the Police
Fuck it I approach the danger
Cause I don't give a fuck if somebody gotta get fucked up
So you might as well kiss your ass goodbye
Cause in the long run 
Alright motherfucka come on! 
Get yo' motherfuckin' hands off me motherfuckin' police officer
Hey, fuck you! 
I ain't bullshiting! 
Man fuck that shit man, I'm tired of you motherfuckers fuckin wit me! 
Fuck you up! 
That's why y'all always gettin' bust on, motherfucker, shit. Y'all always tweaking man! 
Just get in the motherfuckin' cell and shut the fuck up! 
Shit man, I'm tired of you motherfuckers fuckin' with me all the time man, I'm tired of this shit man. I'mma call my bitch, she gonna come get me up out this motherfucker, aye, what you smiling at in the corner nigga? Shut up and pass me a cigarette fool. Man I'm tellin' you my bitch gonna come get me up outta here! 
 Leroy? 
 Bitch this ain't no motherfuckin' Leroy, aye I'm in motherfuckin' jail, you better come get me up outta here, it's me baby wassup! ? 
First of all I ain't yo' bitch, Second of all I ain't commin' to get you out of
Ahh fuck that! 
Motherfuckin' nowhere, motherfucker! 
Nah Fuck you

Aye, thi ye, you better come pick me up from this motherfucker, that's all I know. Aye aye what you talkin' bout phone check nigga, you better wait your turn foo.
Aye come get me up outta here baby, that's on the real real.
Aye, if you don't i'll tell my other bitch to come get me, fuck it, I'll just drop you, fuck it! 
Yo' wassup niggas and niggettes.
If you ever have a problem like this don't call that broke ass nigga you got, and don't call that sorry bitch that don't give a fuck about you anyways. What you need to do is call 1-900-2-Compton 
1-900-2-Compton, that's 1-900-2-Compton. This show was sponsored by the niggas that don't give a fuck phone line!
What we gonna do right here is go back
Now this is some shit that's from the days of wayback
When niggas in Compton first started to jack
When the bitches wouldn't give you no pussy if you wasn't sellin' drugs
So many bitches in my neighborhood got mugged
They always loved that shit, they want a nigga that's sellin' keys
But nowadays they workin' at Mickey D's
But in the days of wayback, I couldn't be laid back
Because I needed ends and I made that
I get the nine from my nigga that he lend me and
Start robbin' muthafuckas, just like cowboys and indians
Anything it took to get paid
A nigga like Ren already had the plan made
And I was in it to win it and not to lose
And shit, it start blowin' up, once I lit the fuse
And police couldn't touch me because I was payin'em
But not with no money, yo, I was sprayin''em
And never get caught because nobody is snitch
But one ho did - so Ren had to shoot the bitch! 
Now she's in a coffin and my life is better off and
Cause everybody knows who's the bossin':
That black nigga that they call Ren
You fuck with me, you gotta fuck with a Mac-10
So listen to me as I reminisce the days of wayback
So check it out y'all
It was once a time in the days of wayback
When niggas was gettin' jacked
In fact it was one I used to pass through up
And kickin' ass through up
Muthafuckin' Compton Massacre...
Now let me tell you a little something about Compton
When I was a kid and puttin' my bid in
Yo, Compton was like still water - just strictly calm
Now it's like muthafuckin' Vietnam
Everybody killin', tryin' to make a killin'
Niggas stealin', muthafuckas willin' to dealin'
With so many ways to come up
The average nigga didn't give a fuck
About another muthafucka in this game and
Claimin' what he claimin'
Livin' like he livin'
Killin' after killin'
Murder was a dirty job. To rob a dead man
Was the best plan cause a dead man never ran
But now your best friend is your worst friend
Greed, cash the fee. Make a me more some of what you holdin'
So now your shit is stolen
And you and your niggas start rollin'
Yo, to get your shit back ain't a word of
Muff? I's more murder, more murder, more murder
They wanna make you think that it's a crack thang
Or a black thang
Or some niggas in a muthafuckin' gang...
But guns and money they go together like the Ku Klux Klan
A nigga brung up and strung up
Why do I call myself a nigga you ask me? 
Rememberin' the days that's past me...
Yo, never givin' niggas a chance to rest
The ghetto is like a fuckin' survival test
And number one way for you to pass
Yo, get treated like a king and they'll crown your ass
They never in the wrong though
So I made a song so
Muthafuckas would know
If your livin' situations make you wanna get a gat...
That's cause you livin' in the Dayz of Wayback...
Surprise, niggas! 
You don't think i can do it again, bitch... Another album... The jokes on you Jack... We did it again... Let's go, LL...
Q-Tip is my title, I don't think that it's vital
For me to be your idol, but dig this recital
If you can't envision a brother who ain't dissing
Slinging this and that,'cause this and that was missing
Instead, it's been injected, the Tribe has been perfected
Oh yes, it's been selected, the art makes it protected
Afrocentric living, Africans be givin'
A lot to the cause,'cause the cause has been risen
Some brothers, they be flamming, thinking we ain't slammin'
Coming off like the days when we used to wear the tans and
A blue-collar talker, hemisphere stalker
A glass of OJ and a ten mile walk-a
If you're in a Jeep and you dig what you're hearing
Can I get a beep and a side order of cheering? 
I am what I am, that's a tribal man
We all know the colors, we all must stand
As we start our travels, things they will unravel
Que sera sera, for this unit is like gravel
Won't be gone for long, listen to the song
If you can't pull it, all ya gotta do is
Push it along, push it along
Push it along, yeah, push it along
Put one up for the Phifer, it's time to decipher
The ills of the world make the situation lighter
The clock is always ticking, the systems should be kickin'
Like Tip said in 
Ham and Eggs, I eat chicken, chicken, chicken
Should I release the lever, the lever of the clever
Embellish on the funk as we start to endeavor? 
The roots of the rap filling up the gap
With the smash of a hand and a little toe tap
The boom, the bip, the boom bip
Indicates to the brothers that we be on the flip tip
Phonies start to crumble, funky rhythm rumbles
Through the dance-hall, but my anthem is humble
I's the nitty-gritty, my time is itty-bitty
So I kick the slash for the gipper and the witty
This ain't trial and error, more like tribin' era
Constantly rude as some sort of tribal terror
The street can't depart from the bloody heart
Repair the wear and tear, don't stop'fore it starts
Won't be gone for long, listen to the song
If you can't pull it, all ya gotta do is
Push it along, push it along
Push it along, yeah, push it along
Marching off the project, we hope that you will subject
I's good to be an object and never, ever reject
The tribe who meanders with drunken propaganda
Keep it in boom and never will we slander
Redeems should be handed, don't let me demand it
Money gives a nudge to the poet star bandit
Control it, then recluse it, follow, you won't lose it
Mysterious is the tribe for we choose it
Although she's flipping crazy, give my love to Gracie
God, could you help'cause this Quest is crazy spacey? 
The pigs are wearing blue, and in a year or two
We'll be going up the creek in a great big canoe
What we gonna do, save me and my brothers? 
Hop inside the bed and pull over the covers
Never will we do that and we ain't trying to rule that
We just want a slab of the ham, don't you know, black? 
This society of fake reality
Are nothing but a peg of informality
While I sing my song, sing it all day long
If you can't pull it, all ya gotta do is
Push it along, push it along
Push it along, yeah, push it along
Brother, brother, brother, Lucien, you're like no other
Listen very close'cause I don't like to boast
Instead, I'll tell the tale of a French who prevailed
Through the Mr. Crazy Rabbits who were always on his tail
We ain't on sale, your rumor starts to wail
Get caught with stolen goods and you will go to jail
If you go to jail, then who will pay the bail? 
Deport you back to France on a ship with a sail
Escargot, Lucien, you eat snails
From the Zulu nation, from a town called Paris
Came to America to find liberty
Instead of finding pleasure, all you found was misery
But listen, Lucien, you have a friend in me
Oh, luck-luck will drive your butt batty
Next time you get some wheels, make it a Caddy
In terms of doing good, I know you wish you really could
But listen, brother man, I really think you can
Succeed with the breed of the brothers on your back
I's the creme de la creme, and you can vouch for that
I'll take a minute, rice, so take my advice
Trust in us, and thus you trust in your life
Lucien, Lucien, Lucien, Lucien - you should know! 
- What? Oh Tip, man, why you do that to me, man? 
I though he was a friend, yo
Oh man, can't believe that
Oh, why you do that to me? 
I  like this
I can do it by myself
Yo, it's 
Are you ready, Lu? This one is for you
Comin' from a true-blue, fits like a shoe
¿Cómo está usted?  or 
Comment allez-vous
Lucien, I'll leave it up to you
Voulez-vous? 
Rendez-vous 
Coucou 
Les poupous 
Watch that lass, gonna backlash fast
Can you get a grip on the crackhead dip? 
Sold you a paper bag, guess he saw you comin'
VCR from a neck-bone bummin'
$10 brother, he was hummin' and strummin'
Only had 20, he was livin' like ya slummin'
Gave him the money, well, I thought that was somethin'
Lookin' like a kid who was lost in crumbin'
Don't worry about a thing, I won't get specific
This is a song that is long and prolific
Think of the stuff that I said if you can
Figure it out, compute, understand
No problemo, I'll help you with your demo
If you go to the store for me
Lucien, I'm just kiddin'
You should know! 
You gotta get a grip on the missions you'll be takin'
Not so much the mission, but you got crazy ignition
Sure, the sugar-babies wanna give you a chance
With the French savoir faire and the sexy glance
But is she really fly, or is she a guy? 
I won't ask why,'cause I know that you try
You try too hard, is that the answer to the riddle? 
Instead of doin' so much, why don't you do just a little? 
Boy, what a cad, I guess we shouldn't treat him bad
In fact, it would be nice if we understood him like
A case of positionin' the feet in the shoes
Sympathetic reason in the case of the blues
Lucien is blue, even though he's really brown
I had to make the sound, his life is too profound
On the up-and-up, he's somethin' like a little pup
Young and naive, it's hard to believe
As long as you're strong, you can quest with the Questers
Jolly like a jumping bean or a jester
Lucien, Lucien, Lucien, Lucien
You should know! 
Oh Tip, everything, you gonna be alright, man
Thank you , man
I think I'll going home, man
Bye-bye, I'll see you tonight
Oh Tip, , I'm not here
After hours it was cool, after hours it was cool
After hours it was cool, after hours it was cool
After hours it was cool, after hours it was cool
After hours it was cool, after hours it was cool
Ten after one I think I'll hop the horse
Downtown 83 of course
Just came from fishing, couldn't get a catch
Downtown they'll probably have a batch
A whiting sandwich and a Guinness Stout
But with the beer though I had a bout
So I exchanged it for some apple juice
I had the blues but I shook them loose
A jeep is blasting from the urban streets
Loops of funk over hardcore beats
The moon dabbles in the morning sky
As the minutes just creep on by
I get a thought and here comes my Tribe
Ritual shakes and in good vibes
Like always the Quest begins
In the mist though but the rhythms moving
We find a spot and we sit and chat
Speaking on the status quo of rap
A derelict makes a real long speech
We pay attention to the words he read
When he was done we rattled on
There was no rush because it wasn't dawn
We pointed things out about these times
The worlds famines and the crazy crimes
Inflation of the nation, it bothers me
I better go gold, to pay the taxes
Gotta be swift'n society
The man whose made is the man who maxes
The grounds for living are being discussed
As we go, it gets close to dusk
Gather thoughts and savor breath
'Cause there's only a few hours left
After hours it was cool, after hours it was cool
After hours it was cool, after hours it was cool
After hours it was cool, after hours it was cool
After hours it was cool, after hours it was cool
Me oh my, hey-hey, hey-hey
The human hours are here to stay
This is how it seems as Phife's my witness
Bug out all night, ask Phife, he's with this
Girls be screaming on this conversation
I have my two cents for a revelation
And my watch continuously tic-tocks
Shaheed will bring up the beats that rocks
I hear the frogs and the smashing of bottles
A car revs up and I hear it throttle
It probably moves with the morning wind
Oh my God, here's Phife again
Hear him talking about last night's game
Trying to remember someone's name
So hear the frogs dancing in the streets
Once again Ali will bring up the beat
Like this
*sounds of frogs
The beat is over and so is the night
The sun is risen and the shine is bright
We all say peace and go our separate ways
Youth is fading as we gain our days
Expedition for the song is simp'
The hours creep, excuse me, I mean limp
As we go you hear a gasp of laugh
As we start up our rhythmic path
Like this
After hours it was cool, after hours it was cool
After hours it was cool, after hours it was cool
After hours it was cool, after hours it was cool
After hours it was cool, after hours it was cool
As we start trudging, me and my brothers we be looking and be bugging
Vehicles of life they be rolling and be nudging
Searching for the virgins of life
That be shoving out the door that's crack
The valleys of time, are always on my feet
As least the beat will combine
The calluses and corns with the funky bassline
You don't need Underdog for a nickel shoeshine or the shoes that's phat
Well can I get a level on the bass and on the treble
Footing up and down like a UNLV Rebel
The answer be amongst us cos we rarely dig acoustics
Can't be too much flacking, not too much packing
You must container that at least to dip your hand in rap
Your feet will be infectious so at least realise the fact
The rhythms are inserted and the nurse can be converted
This ain't rock'n' roll cos the rap is in control
If you're a megastar, worth will buy you a car
I'd rather go barefooting, for prints I will be putting
All over the earth if we can get there first
Now that we are in it, footprints are being printed
So if you recognize em, you can try to size em
They'll probably be the ones with the size not frying
All over reveal, you won't have to yield
If you want protection you can hide behind the shield
You can game on the gallons if you really need to rock
But we walk while we talk as we stomping through the block
Hand in hand'cross the land as Muhammad cross the fade
I's a Tribe who meanders, precious like a jade
I's a art, Theo arch rhymes the ground placed upon
The mind will unwind, it will soft to beyond
Catch the track, track by track, get a map to track a trail
You will find yourself behind for a map does not prevail
See the levels peaking as the rhythms keep-a screeching
A Quest, oh yes a Quest, inside the jam I will keep preaching
The point, oh yes the point, because it's close but yet so far
The loudiness is ringing as we scoot across the star
We are bulging, I'm indulging in a rat-a-tat-tat
Explanation for the liners that the rhythm is phat
Keep it wild, wide and deep, you could dig it in a jeep
But dig it in the ground because the foot print now
If there's a storm that's brewing, it won't keep us from doing
Our thing as we start swinging, travelling is bringing
Joy inside the domes as we hit the road to roam/Rome
A chair is not a chair, a house is not a home
Because my skin is brown, yo I'm gonna do the town
Rub it in the face and rub my feet all through the place
When you get your finger on the music it'll linger
Sing a song o' sixpence, sing it like a singer
A Nubian, a Nubian, a proud one at that
Remember me, the brother who said 
Black is black
You can come by request, I don't play, I don't dress
Get emotions off your chest, we are black, we the best
Making moves, making motions, flowing like an ocean
The walking will continue, we know that we will bring you
The times that you have waited, more anticipated
Be gone but not for long because the feet will stay strongCrowd noise
In today's music news: the ever-controversial 2Pac Shakur has just released another album under the alias 
Makaveli. Music insiders are running wild trying to rearrange other artists' street dates in fear of a wipeout in retail interchart movement. Although no one knows the exact cause of the new album, resources tell me a number of less fortunate rappers have joined together in conspiracy to assassinate the character of not only Mr. Shakur but of Death Row Records as well. Nas, the alleged ring leader, is furious at 2Pac's – excuse me – Makaveli's verbal assault on Mobb Sleep, Notorious P.I.G., and several other New York rappers. Jay-Z from 
Hawaiian Sophie fame, Big Little whatever, and several other corny-sounding motherfuckers are understandably shaken up by this release. The question everybody wants to know is: why'd they get this nigga started? 2Pac – rather Makaveli – was not available for comment but released this statement:
I's not about East or West
I's about niggas and bitches, power and money, ridaz and punks
Which side are you on? 
*gunshots followed by several encroaching footsteps*
These niggas is still fuckin' talkin'? 
You niggas still breathin'? Fuckin' roaches, aight
Aight, it's the Raid for you cockroaches
Punk motherfuckers, this is it 
Killuminati Style  
  Solo shit, Bring it! 
  Allow me to introduce first: Makaveli the Don
Hysterical, spiritual lyrics like The Holy Qur'an
Niggas get shook like 5-0
My.45 is next to me when we ride, for survival
Money-makin' plans, pistol close at hand, swollen pockets
Let me introduce the topic, then we drop it
Expose snakes ‘cause they breed freely
See me rise, located worldwide like the art of graffiti
I think I'm tougher than Nitti, my attitude is shitty
Born on a dope fiend's titty, in every city
You'll find me, look for trouble right behind me
My Outlaw niggas down to die for me, know what I mean? 
I hit the scene, niggas duckin' from my guillotine stare
I'm right there, my every word a fuckin' nightmare
Get me high, let me see the sun rise and fall
This for my dogs down to die for y'all
Extreme venom, no mercy when we all up in ’em
Cut ’em down, to Hell is where we send ’em
My whole team trained to explode, ride or die
Murder motherfuckers lyrically and I'm not gonna cry
Me, a born leader, never leave the block without my heater
Two big pits, I call them my bitch-nigga eaters
And not a whimper until I'm gone
Thug Life runnin' through my veins so I'm strong
Bye bye bye, let's get high and ride
Oh, how do we do these niggas, but I'm not gonna cry
I'm a Bad Boy killer, Jay-Z die too
Lookin' out for Mobb Deep, nigga, when I find you
Weak motherfuckers don't deserve to breathe
How many niggas down to die for me? Yay-yay
West Coast rider, comin' right behind ya
Should have never fucked with me
I want money, hoes, sex and weed
I won't rest until my road dog's free – bomb first
We bomb first when we ride
Please reconsider'fore you die
We ain't even come to hurt nobody tonight
But it's my life or your life, and I'ma bomb first
We bomb first when we ride
Please reconsider'fore you die
We ain't even come to fight tonight
But it's my life or your life, and I'ma bomb first
For so many days, in so many ways
We've been duckin' strays they delivers
But still we some Bad Boy killers
Got nothin' to lose, I gots nowhere to go
I only got one home, see me stranded on Death Row
With Outlawz, it's Makaveli be the general
And I be a soldier on a mission
Sent to do what you'll never do
And that's ride for the cause, yes I'll die for the cause
You best believe, if I'ma leave this bitch, yo I'm dyin' with yours
Kamikaze, sicker than a motherfuckin' Nazi
Got a little question for that nigga that made 
Paparazzi
If you ain't in this rap game
For the motherfuckin' cash, mane
Then what is your motherfuckin' purpose? None can serve us
E.D.I. Mean, born worthless
That's until the day I decided to bomb first, bitch! 
Biatch! Come on, bring it, down with it! 
Then we ride
Come on, bring it
Bomb first when we ride
Hey, get that nigga! 
Your style wack as ever, like you was rockin' patent leather
Causin' massive terror, y'all niggas lack, you ain't thorough
Half rapper, half drug kingpin
You're tellin' fairy tales, dunn
King of New York like you the motherfuckin' one? 
But I'm from Jers' and we don't play that shit
From the Clare down to North Bricks
All my niggas flippin’ chips, gettin’ rich, even though it's hard
Tryin' to creep through these halls and brawls
Without scarred by a revolve
With no warning signs, ‘cause yo, my man took five
Now I'm the young one with the 9 ready to put in my time
Shoot first, look at their head, burst bleeding
Don't want to hear no shit this evening, believe me
We bomb first when we ride
Please reconsider'fore you die
G's and thug niggas on the rise
Plan, plot, strategize, and bomb first
We bomb first when we ride
Please reconsider'fore you die
G's and thug niggas on the rise
Plan, plot, strategize, and bomb first
Start of 
Hail Mary
Let us pray, my niggas
For we have definitely sinned
Makaveli in this, Killuminati
All through your body
That blows like a 12-gauge shotty, feel me! 
And God said he should send his one begotten son
To lead the wild into the ways of the man
Follow me! Eat my flesh, flesh of my flesh! 
Come with me! 
Hail Mary, nigga, run quick, see
What do we have here now? Do you wanna ride or die? 
La la-da-la la la la la
Come with me! 
Hail Mary, nigga, run quick, see
What do we have here now? Do you wanna ride or die? 
La la-da-la la la la la
I ain't a killer, but don't push me
Revenge is like the sweetest joy next to gettin' pussy
Picture paragraphs unloaded, wise words bein' quoted
Peeped the weakness in the rap game and sewed it
Bow down, pray to God, hopin' that he's listenin'
Seein' niggas comin' for me
Through my diamonds, when they glistenin'
Now pay attention: bless me please, Father, I'm a ghost
In these killing fields, Hail Mary, catch me if I go
Let's go deep inside the solitary mind of a madman
Screams in the dark, evil lurks, enemies see me flee
Activate my hate, let it break to the flame
Set trip, empty out my clip, never stop to aim
Some say the game is all corrupt and fucked in this shit
Stuck, niggas is lucky if we bust out this shit
Plus, Mama told me never stop until I bust a nut
Fuck the world if they can't adjust, it's just as well, Hail Mary
Come with me! 
Hail Mary, nigga, run quick, see
What do we have here now? Do you wanna ride or die? 
La la-da-la la la la la
Come with me! 
Hail Mary, nigga, run quick, see
What do we have here now? Do you wanna ride or die? 
La la-da-la la la la la
Penitentiaries is packed with promise-makers
Never realize the precious time that bitch niggas is wastin'
Institutionalized, I live my life a product made to crumble
But too hardened for a smile, we're too crazy to be humble
We ballin', catch me, father, please
‘Cause I'm fallin' in the liquor store
Pass the Hennessy, I hear you callin', can I get some more? 
Hell,'til I reach Hell, I ain't scared
Mama checkin' in my bedroom, I ain't there
I got a head with no screws in it, what can I do? 
One life to live, but I got nothin' to lose
Just me and you on a one-way trip to prison, sellin' drugs
We all wrapped up in this livin', life as thugs
To my homeboys in Clinton Max doin' their bid
Raise hell to this real shit and feel this
When they turn out the lights, I'll be there in the dark
Thuggin' eternal through my heart; now hail Mary, nigga! 
Come with me! 
Hail Mary, nigga, run quick, see
What do we have here now? Do you wanna ride or die? 
La la-da-la la la la la
Come with me! 
Hail Mary, nigga, run quick, see
What do we have here now? Do you wanna ride or die? 
La la-da-la la la la la
They got a APB out on my thug family
Since Outlawz run these streets like these scandalous freaks
Our enemies die now, walk around half-dead
Head down, K-blasted off of Hennessy and Thai chronic
Mixed in, now I'm twisted, blistered and high
Visions of me thug-livin' gettin' me by
Forever live, and I multiply, survived by thugs
When I die they won't cry unless they comin' with slugs
Peep the whole scene and whatever's goin' on around me
Brain kind of cloudy, smoked out, feelin' rowdy
Ready to wet the party up
And whoever in that mothafucka, nasty new street slugger
My heat seeks suckers on the regular
Mashin' in a stolen Black Ac' Integra
Cocked back, 60 seconds'til the draw, that's when I'm deadin' ya
Feet first, you've got a nice gat, but my heat's worse
From a thug to preachin' church
I gave you love, now you eatin' dirt
Needin' work, and I ain't the nigga to put you on
‘Cause word is bond; when I was broke, I had to hustle'til dawn
That's when the sun came up, there's only one way up
Hold your head and stay up
To all my niggas, get your pay and weight up
If it's on, then it's on, we rape break beat-breaks
Outlawz on a paper chase, can you relate? 
To this shit I don't got be the shit I gotta take
Dealin' with fate, hopin' God don't close the gate
If it's on, then it's on, we rape break beat-breaks
Outlawz on a paper chase, can you relate? 
To this shit I don't got be the shit I gotta take
Dealin' with fate, hopin' God don't close the gate
Come with me! 
Hail Mary, nigga, run quick, see
What do we have here now? Do you wanna ride or die? 
La la-da-la la la la la
Come with me! 
Hail Mary, nigga, run quick, see
What do we have here now? Do you wanna ride or die? 
La la-da-la la la la la
Come with me! 
Hail Mary, nigga, run quick, see
What do we have here now? Do you wanna ride or die? 
La la-da-la la la la la
Come with me! 
Hail Mary, nigga, run quick, see
What do we have here now? Do you wanna ride or die? 
La la-da-la la la la la
We've been travelin' on this weary road
Sometimes life can be a heavy load
But we ride, ride it like a bullet
Hail Mary, hail Mary
We won't worry, everything will curry
Free like the bird in the tree
We won't worry, everything will curry
Yes, we free like the bird in the tree
We runnin' from the penitentiary
This is the time for we liberty
Hail Mary, hail Mary! 
Westside, Outlawz
Makaveli the Don, solo
Killuminati, The 7 Days
The money behind the dreams
My right hand, my other Capo in this big motherfuckin' war we got
My other Capo in this big-ass
Conglomerate called Death Row
Snoop motherfuckin Dogg, Tha Doggfather
And who's he coming through right now? 
Makaveli the Don
Feel this, Killuminati
Lord have mercy, father help us all
Since you supplied your phone number, I can't help but call
Time for action, conversating, we relaxing, kicking back
Got you curious for thug passion, now picture that
Tongue-kissing, hand full of hair, look in my eyes
Time to make the bed rock, baby look how it rise
Me and you moving in the nude, do it in the living room
Sweating up the sheets, it's the Thug in me
I mean no disrespecting when I tongue-kiss your neck
I go a long way to get you wet, what you expect? 
Late night, hit the highway, drop the top
I pull over, getting busy in the parking lot
And don't you love it how I lick your hips and glide? 
Kiss you soft on your stomach, push my love inside
Got you lost in a love zone, stuck in the lust
I got the bedroom shaking, back-breaking
When we're tossing it up
Feel this baby, I like the way it's going down
When nobody's around, slip-slide ride
Giving me that nice smile
Female I like, what I want to give all night
You and me alone, everybody's gone, toss it up
Baby let's get it on! 
I like the way you please me, baby
The sexy way you tease me, shorty
The way you move your body
It really drives me crazy
Your body hypnotizing, your smell is so exciting
So baby come on home with me
I like the way you give it to me, baby
I like the way you give it to me
Let me see you toss it up
I like the way you give it to me
Let me see you toss it up
I like the way you give it to me
Let me see you toss it up
I like the way you give it to me
Let me see you toss it up
Play on, play on, play on, play on
Play on, play on, play on, play on
Play on, play on, play on, play on
Play on, play on, play on, play on
Oh, it's K-Ci baby, mmm, that want you lady
Oh, don't act so shady
Baby, your taste as fine as gravy
The way you move that thang, you make me wanna sang
Girl you make my bells rang, make them go ting-a-ling! 
Nasty man, I'm here again
Don't want it to ever end
I's feeling too good
Gimme some more, oh lady, lady
Your body the kind I like-ah
Big booty titillating delight-ah
Back it up yo, let me in there
Toss it up for me
I like the way you give it to me
Let me see you toss it up
I like the way you give it to me
Let me see you toss it up
I like the way you give it to me
Let me see you toss it up
I like the way you give it to me
Let me see you toss it up
So won't you play on
How do you want it? What's your phone number? I get around
Cali Love to my true Thugs, picture me now
Still down for that Death Row sound, searching for paydays
No longer Dre Day: arrivederci
Blown and forgotten, rotten for plotting Child's Play
Check your sexuality, as fruity as this Alize
Quick to jump ship, punk trick, what a dumb move
Cross Death Row, now who you gonna run to? 
Laugh at you suckers cause you similar
Pretending to be hard, oh my God, check your temperature
Screaming 
Compton, but you can't return, you ain't heard? 
Brothers pissed cause you switched and escaped to the burbs
Mob on to this new era, cause we untouchable
Still can't believe that you got'Pac rushing you
Up in you, bless the real, all the rest get killed
Who can you trust? Only time reveals
Toss it up
Let me see you toss it up
Let me see you toss it up
Let me see you toss it up
Let me see you toss it up
Yeah no doubt
Toss it up now
Play on playa, play on
How can some non-players do a song about tossing it up
And then want to do a player song? 
How can non-players do it? 
Teddy Riley, who? Puffy? who? 
Puffy, I read your little interview buddy, c'mon
You still ain't touching us, all that peace talk
I don't care if you kiss my ass from here to across the street, boy
I's on! Toss it up, we took you on
And we took y'all beat 
You know who beat we took, and we took y'all beat
Cause you wasn't rocking it right! 
Tired of suckers rocking beats that don't belong to them, toss it up, it's on, it's out there now, it's our beat now
Yeah, toss it up now!“Street Science, you’re on the air. What do you feel when you hear a record like 2Pac’s new one? ”
“I love 2Pac’s new record.”
“Right, but don’t you feel like that creates tension between East and West? I mean, he’s talking about killing people, ‘I had sex with your wife’ — and not in those words. But he’s talking about, ‘I wanna see you deceased’…
To live and die in L.A., California
What you say about Los Angeles? 
Still the only place for me
It never rains in Southern California
To live and die in L.A.
Where everyday we try to fatten our pockets
Us niggas hustle for the cash, so it's hard to knock it
Everybody got they own thing, currency chasin'
Worldwide through the hard times, worrying faces
Shed tears as we bury niggas close to heart
Who was a friend is now a ghost in the dark
Cold-hearted'bout it, nigga got smoked by a fiend
Tryin' to floss on him, blind to a broken man's dream
A hard lesson, court cases keep me guessin'
Plea bargain ain't an option now, so I'm stressin'
Cost me more to be free than a life in the pen
Makin' money off of cuss words, writin' again
Learn how to think ahead, so I fight with my pen
Late night down sunset, likin' the scene
What's the worst they could do to a nigga? 
Got me lost in Hell, to live and die in L.A. on bail
My angel sing
To live and die in L.A., it's the place to be
And the angels go
You've got to be there to know it
When everybody wanna see
To live and die in L.A.
To live and die in L.A., it's the place to be
You've got to be there to know it
When everybody wanna see
I's the city of angels and constant danger
South Central L.A. can't get no stranger
Full of drama, like a soap opera, on the curb
Watchin' the ghetto bird helicopters, I observe
So many niggas gettin' three strikes, tossed in jail
I swear, the pen right across from hell
I can't cry, ‘cause it's on now
I'm just a nigga on his own now
Livin' life thug style, so I can't smile
Writing to my peoples when they ask for pictures
Thinkin' Cali just fun and bitches
Better learn about the dress code, B's and C's
All them other niggas copycats, these is G's
I love Cali like I love women
‘Cause every nigga in L.A. got a little bit of thug in him
We might fight amongst each other
But I promise you this: we'll burn this bitch down
Get us pissed, to live and die in L.A
My angel sing
To live and die in L.A., it's the place to be
And the angels go
You've got to be there to know it
When everybody wanna see
To live and die in L.A.
To live and die in L.A., it's the place to be
You've got to be there to know it
When everybody wanna see
It wouldn't be L.A. without Mexicans
Black love, brown pride, and the sets again
Pete Wilson tryin' to see us all broke
I'm on some bullshit out for everything they owe
Remember K-day? Weekends, Crenshaw, MLK? 
Automatics rang free, niggas lost they way
Gang signs being shown, nigga, love your hood
But recognize and it's all good
Where the weed at? Niggas gettin' shermed out
Snoop Dogg in this mothafucka permed out
M.O.B., Big Suge in the Lo-Lo, bounce and turn
Dogg Pound in the Lex with a ounce to burn
Got them Watts niggas with me, O.F.T.B.
They got some hash, took the stash, left the rest for me
Neckbone, Tray, Heron, Big Buntry too
Big Rock got knocked, but this one's for you
I hit the studio and drop a jewel, hopin' it pay
Gettin' high, watchin' time fly; to live and die in L.A
To live and die in L.A., it's the place to be
Let my angel sing
You've got to be there to know it
When everybody wanna see
And my angels go
To live and die in L.A., it's the place to be
To live and die in L.A.
You've got to be there to know it
When everybody wanna see
Let my angel sing
This go out for 92.3, and 106
All the radio stations that be bumpin' my shit
Makin' my shit sells katruple quitraple platinum
This go out to all the magazines that support a nigga
All the real motherfuckers
All the stores, the mom and pop spots
A&R people, all y'all mothafuckers
L.A., 
California Love part mothafuckin' two
Without gay ass Dre

To Live & Die in L.A. fades out*​​​​​​​
God has a plan, and the bible unfolds that wonderful plan
Through the message of prophecy
God sent Jesus into this world to be our savior
And that Christ is returning, someday soon
To unfold the wonderful plan of eternity
For my life and your life
As long as we're cooperating with God
By accepting Jesus Christ as our personal Lord and savior
Unless the Lord does return in the coming seven days
We'll see you next time here on This Week in Bible Prophecy
2Pac, don't start that blasphemy in here! 
Makaveli, the new breed
And I remember what my pops told me
The new word, follow me
Remember what my pops told me
My family tree consists of drug dealers, thugs and killers
Strugglin', known to hustle, screamin', fuck they feelings! 
I got advice from my father, all he told me was this:
Nigga, get off your ass if you plan to be rich! 
There's ten rules to the game, but I'll share with you two
Know niggas gon' hate you for whatever you do
Now, rule one: get your cash on, M.O.B.
That's Money Over Bitches,'cause they breed envy
Now, rule two is a hard one: watch for phonies
Keep your enemies close, nigga, watch your homies
It seemed a little unimportant, when he told me, I smiled
Picture jewels bein' handed to an innocent child
I never knew, in my lifetime, I'd live by these rules
Initiated as an outlaw, studyin' rules
Now, papa ain't around, so I gotta recall
Or come to grips with bein' written on my enemy's walls
Promised if I have a seed, I'ma guide him right
Dear Lord, don't let me die tonight
I got words for my comrades, listen and learn
Ain't nothin' free, get back what you earned
No doubt, gettin' higher than a motherfucka, bless me, please
This Thug Life'll be the death of me
C'mon, yeah
And I remember what my pops told me
Remember what my pops told me
Blasphemy! 
Nuf for dem dat steal in the name of da Lord
Dem a tell nuff lie, but holdin' my bird in a cloud
Using the name of the lord in vain
While de people in de ghetto feel nuff pain
We pro'ly in Hell, already, our dumb asses not knowin'
Everybody kissin' ass to go to Heaven ain't goin'
Put my soul on it, I'm fightin' devil niggas daily
Plus the media be crucifyin' brothers severely
Tell me I ain't God's son; nigga, momma a virgin
We got evicted, had to leave the'burbs
Back in the ghetto, doin' wild shit
Lookin' at the sun don't pay
Criminal mind all the time, wait for Judgment Day
They say Moses split the Red Sea
I split the blunt and rolled a fat one up, deadly
Babylon beware, comin' for the Pharoah's kids
Retaliation, makin' legends off the shit we did
Still bullshittin', niggas in Jerusalem waitin' for signs
God comin', she's just takin' her time 
Livin' by the Nile, while the water flow
I’m contemplatin' plots, wonderin' where the thought’ll go
Brothas gettin' shot, comin' back resurrected
I's just that raw shit, nigga, check it 
And I remember what my pops told me
Remember what my pops told me
Blasphemy! 
Nuff a dem a steal in the name of the lord
Dem a tell nuff lie, but holding a bird in a cloud
Using the name of the lord in vain
While de people in de ghetto feel nuff pain
The preacher want me buried, why?'Cause I know he a liar
Have you ever seen a crackhead? That's eternal fire
Why you got these kids' minds thinkin' that they evil? 
While the preacher bein' freaky, you say, honor God's people
Should we cry when the Pope die? My request:
We should cry if they cried when we buried Malcolm X
Mama, tell me: am I wrong? Is God just another cop
Waitin' to beat my ass if I don't go pop? 
Memories of a past time, givin' up cash to the leaders
Knowin' damn well they ain't gonna feed us
In my brain, how can you explain time in B.C.? 
I's hard enough to live, now, in these times of greed
They say Jesus is a kind man
Well, he should understand times in this crime land
My thug nation, do what you gotta do
But know you gotta change
Try to find a way to make it out the game
I leave this and hope God can see my heart is pure
Is Heaven just another door? I leave this here
I leave this and hope God see my heart is pure
Is Heaven just another door? And my people say
Nuff a dem a steal in the name of the lord
Dem a tell nuff lie, but holding a bird in a cloud
Using the name of the lord in vain
While de people in de ghetto feel nuff pain
Our father, who art in Heaven
Hallow be Thy name
Thy kingdom come, Thy will be done
In Earth as it is in Heaven
Give us this day, our daily bread
As we give up our debts
As we forgive our debt-ors
Lead us not into temptation
But deliver us unevil
For God is the kingdom and the power
And the glory forever and ever and ever
In the life we live as thugs
Everybody fuckin' with us so can't you see
I's hard to be a man
Ridin' with my guns in hand
Why explain the game
Niggas ain't listenin', stuck in positions
If victims can't stand the heat then stay the fuck out the kitchen
Half these busters switchin', lookin' at me mean
Itchin', givin' suckers plenty space
Have these bitch niggas snitchin'
Where are we now, guns found daily
The feds surely hope that they could finally nail me
For sellin' dope they backwards
Make the track burst, whenever I rap
Attack
Words been known to explode on contact
Extreme at times
Blinded by my passion and fury
Look at me laugh at my competition's flashin' my jewelry
You'd stay silent if you niggas knew me
Truely effective
The shit you heard ain't do me justice
Got a death wish, bitch
Run, but face being traced, by the infrared beam
It seems niggas ain't recognize my team
Ain't nobody holdin' you back, explode the track to confetti
Unload it
'Cause niggas ain't ready
The life of an outlaw
In the life we live as thugs
Everybody fuckin' with us so can't you see
I's hard to be a man
Ridin' with my guns in hand
Code 3
Attack formation
Pull out your pistols
Keep an eye out for the devils'cause they itchin' to get you
Merciless madman screamin' kamikaze in tongue
Automatic gunfire makin' all my enemies run
Who should I call when I'm shot and bleedin'? 
Indeed a possibility that's part a chasin' cream
Dope got me hatin' fiends
Scheme with my team, just a chosen few
My foes victim of explosives
Come closer
Exhale the fumes
We got memories fadin' fast
A slave for cash
Accelerate, mash, blast, then dash
Don't look now. How you like it, raw
Niggas ain't ready for the wrath of the outlaws
Never surrender
Death before dishonor, stay free
I'm thugged out
Fuck the world'cause this is how they made me
Scarred but still breathin'
Believe in me and you could see the victory
A warrior in jewels
Will you picture me? 
Life of and outlaw
In the life we live as thugs 
Everybody fuckin' with us , so can't you see 
I's hard to be a man 
Ridin' with my guns in hand
City under siege
I's like I can't even breathe
I'm from the state of car thieves
G, deep from the street
Plenty beef
I play for keeps, arrange the whole crime scene
Mobb peep
They sneak up from behind tryin' to creep
No halfs with no straps, jack
I's on to bounce back
An ounce of wrath so bad, it snatched my style on death
Tell the gripper I was sent to get ya
Snip with clippers
Get the picture
I wrote my life down as a scripture
And still I'm lost in the land of the lonely
Where ain't nobody holy
A matter of a fact, we unholy
Everybody livin' soley for themselves
Too high strung to lend help
To somebody who be needin' it
You know we lost hope and he needin' it
But the evil it's forever
But I'm rappin' low down, scandalous
Like a tramp is
All for the street fame on how to be managed
To plan shit
6 months in advanced to what we plotted
Approached the goal on swole and now I got it
Uh, crack my window
Knowin' they'd love to catch Kastro sleepin'
Attach a strap under my pillow hand to hand like we freakin'
Creepin' deep into the mornin'
Peepin' out the weak while they yawnin'
And let my clout speak for itself
No doubt
Outlaw
Outta my mind, outta time
You're all blind
Some kind of life of mine if K-Dog don't mind
Findin' it funny, matter of fact,'cause it is
Perhaps finally I'll adapt to it over the years as an outlaw
What's up, nigga? 
Hell yeah
On my grandmother, nigga
What's up
Well, now they all say that vultures and parasites
Snakes are all alike
Thug life break night
Drink'til we fist fight
Life or death, but you can't win with a vest
But there won't be no breathin' for the reason
Punk bitch on your breath
I see day is dark and I admit it's dark
So chase on the ave. hide your stash
Beware from them marks
And yo, Makaveli, give me them bullets that was left up in your belly
And let me bust back to them niggas'til they all cold and sweaty
In the life we live as thugs
Everybody fuckin' with us so can't you see
I's hard to be a man
Ridin' with my guns in hand
In the life we live as thugs
Everybody fuckin' with us so can't you see
I's hard to be a man
Ridin' with my guns in hand
In the life we live as thugs
Everybody fuckin' with us so can't you see
I's hard to be a man
Ridin' with my guns in hand
In the life we live as thugs
Everybody fuckin' with us so can't you see
I's hard to be a man
Ridin' with my guns in hand
Outlawz, go ahead, in this
No doubt

Her moms let her do what she please, an' seen no one loved her
Her eyes shined of love, a diamond in the rough
The kind that you could love; not yet touch, but so much, potential
Youngster let me guide ya mental
And to a place, with a sourness of pain you'll never taste
By God's grace, you was born with that face
Nothin' but pure beauty; so for an eternity, I feel it's my duty
To be a souljah  yeah, baby got plans to mold ya
In the coldest nights is when I hold ya
Like I'm supposed to, as we roll closer
I'll take yo' hand gladly, anything you need, ask me
Supportin' my baby girl just like daddy
To alleviate the stress, spendin' time wit' you, I feel blessed
When you gone, feel the pain so strong deep in my chest
When I got arrested, came so close to goin' to jail
Throwin' blows at the po-pos breakin' ya nails
Screamin' loud goin' all out, damn I did
You stayed locked down at moms house, watchin' the kids
Through the whole bid in the V-I, I see ya daily
While my fake homies try to fuck you, you run and tell me
That's why I stay committed, I thank God every time I hit it
Hopin' you'll forgive me for all the times I bullshitted
Me and you against the world, we untouchable
Screamin' like you dyin' every time I'm fuckin' you
Ya never had a father or a family, but I'll be there
No need to fear so much insanity, and through the years
I know ya gave me your heart, plus
When I'm dirt broke and fucked up, ya still love me
Come with me and in time we'll grow
Dedicate slow jams on the radio-oh why

If ya trust me
Close ya eyes, feel the magic
Neva leave when ya need me

Boo, would ya die for me? 
Down holdin' my pistol, gettin' high
With mean sounds tougher than bristles
But when you cry I'll be ya tissue
Back in the county written letters, how I miss you
Givin' you credit, apologetic how I diss you
Kiss you for thinkin' like a mona and on a level
And sometime daddy ready to wine ya and dilation
For a total twine ya, we right behind ya true
Life just me and you, no tellin' what we could do
Gettin' high between the sheets, make the shit right here discrete
Puttin' hickeys on ya belly while we fuckin' on the beach
I love it when ya nut up and grab me
I feel for ya badly, baby girl just like daddy
Shorty I lend my hand out ta help ya, lost soul lookin' for shelter
On late night accept it, treat ya good, won't disrespect ya
My age is young, out of place bitch days is done
From a trixy to a missy, you know I raised ya hun
Placed her under my wing, showed her how we swing
Now she rolling blunts for her king
One day labelled thug misses, the essence of my ghetto sisters
Hugs and kisses, that's just for me to be a father figure
 come with me and in time we'll grow
 Dedicate slow jams on the radio-oh why
 Know ya happy, I can feel ya passion
Lookin' out for ya just like daddy, come on
 Sunshine turns to rain
Baby, I can take away ya pain Jjust like daddy)
If ya trust me

Throw me a cigarette, dawg! inhales
They got me feelin' crazier than a motherfucker
I got Bad Azz in this motherfucker
Makaveli the Don, representin' the Outlawz
Bad Azz representin' the LBC Crew
So what'cha wanna do? Y'know how we do it
Puffin' on lye
Hopin' that it gets me high
Got a nigga goin' crazy
Oh yeah, I feel crazy
Time goes by, puffin' on lye
Hopin' that it gets me high
Got a nigga goin' crazy
Oh yeah, I feel crazy
Last year was a hard one, but life goes on
Hold my head against the wall, learnin' right from wrong
They say my ghetto instrumental detrimental to kids
As if they can't see the misery in which they live
Blame me for the outcome, ban my records – check it
Don't have to bump this, but please respect it
I took a minus and now the hard times are behind us
Turned into a plus, now they stuck livin' blinded
Hennessy got me feelin' bad, time to stop drinkin'
Rollin' in my drop-top Jag, what's that cops thinkin'? 
Sittin' in my car, watch the stars and smoke
I came a long way, but still I got so far to go
Dear Mama, don't worry; I'ma watch for snakes
Tell Setchu that I love her, but it's hard today
I got the letter that she sent me, and I cried for weeks
This what came out when I tried to speak – all I heard was…
Time goes by, puffin' on lye
Hopin' that it gets me high
Got a nigga goin' crazy
I feel crazy
Time goes by, puffin' on lye
Hopin' that it gets me high
Got a nigga goin' crazy
I feel crazy
I see Bloods and Crips runnin' up the hill
Lookin' for a better wayyy
My brothers and sisters, it's time to bail
‘Cause even thug niggas prayyy
Hopin' God hear me, I entered the game
Look how much I changed
I'm no longer innocent – casualties of fame
Made a lot of money, seen a lot of places
And I swear I seen a peaceful smile on my mama's face
When I gave her the keys to her own house, this yo' land
Your only son done became a man
Watchin' time fly, I love my people, do or die
But I wonder why we scared to let each other fly
June 1-6,'7-1, the day
Mama pushed me out her womb, told me, 
Nigga, get paid! 
No one can understand me – the black sheep
Outcasted from my family, now packin' heat
I run the streets, a young runaway, live for today
When he died, I could hear him say… 
Time goes by, puffin' on lye
Hopin' that it gets me high
Got a nigga goin' crazy
I feel crazy
Time goes by, puffin' on lye
Hopin' that it gets me high
Got a nigga goin' crazy
Crazy, crazy, crazy
I feel crazy 
God, help me out here, ‘cause I'm possessed
I need the root of all evil for my stress
‘Cause money's like a strong prescription
Drug, it's got me addicted
To the pleasure and the pain it inflicted
Somethin' about the paper
With the pictures of the president's head
Damn, it's like a motherfuckin' plague that spread
I's epidemic; forgotten, forgotten it got worse
I keep my head on straight, makin' money ‘cause it's cursed
Makin' money makes a difference day by day
So I gotta stay paid, no doubt, day in and day out
This life is like a vicious cycle called fightin' to live
No matter how hard you try, it's in death, you gotta die
A lot of my peers didn't make it to the years to come
Did life doin' right, or did life livin' dumb
Who has the answers? I wonder, I turn to my elders
They aged and experienced, but they can't even tell ya
Or tell me, that there'll be light at the end of the road
 ‘Cause they don't even know
A million things run through my mind
You ain't gotta be in jail to be doin' time
Time goes by, puffin' on lye
Hopin' that it gets me high
Got a nigga goin' crazy
I feel crazy
Time goes by, puffin' on lye
Hopin' that it gets me high
Got a nigga goin' crazy
I feel fucked up in this bitch
I smoked half a ounce to the head
Chocolate Thai, indo, Hawaiian, lambsbread, buddha
All that shit! 
I'm fucked up in this motherfucker
And Hennessy don't help
Thug Passion in this muh'fucker
Makaveli the Don puttin' it down to the fullest
Maximum overload
3 Day Theory, Killuminati to your body
With the impact of a 12 gauge shotty
Double-I slugs, no love, straight thugs
One time for my niggas in the jail cell
One time for my niggas doin' life in Hell
One time for my niggas in the jail cell 
One time for my niggas doin' life in Hell
One time for my niggas on the Death Row
For my niggas on Death Row
One time for my niggas livin' broke
One time for my niggas livin' broke
One time for my niggas in the jail cell
Wonder if it get me high, yeah
You go bustin' your fist against a stone wall. You're not usin' your brain.
That's what the white man wants you to do.
Look at you! What makes you ashamed of bein' black? 
Nothin' but love for you, my sister
Might even know how hard it is, no doubt
Bein' a woman, a black woman at that, no doubt
Shit, in this white man's world
Sometimes we overlook the fact
That we be ridin' hard on our sisters
We don't be knowin' the pain we be causin'
In this white man's world
In this white man's world
I ain't sayin I'm innocent in all this
I'm just sayin', in this white man's world
This song is for y'all
For all those times that I messed up, or we messed up
Dear sister, got me twisted up in prison, I miss ya
Cryin', lookin' at my niece's and my nephew picture
They say don't let this cruel world get ya
Kinda suspicious, swearin' one day you might leave me
For somebody that's richer
Twist the cap off the bottle, I take a sip and see tomorrow
Gotta make it if I have to beg or borrow
Readin' love letters; late night, locked down and quiet
If brothers don't receive they mail, best believe we riot
Eatin' Jack-Mack, starin' at the walls of silence
Inside this cage where they capture all my rage and violence
In time I learned a few lessons, never fall for riches
Apologizes to my true sisters, far from bitches
Help me raise my Black nation, reparations are due
I's true, caught up in this world I took advantage of you
So tell the babies how I love them, precious boys and girls
Born black in this white man's world—and all I heard was
Who knows what tomorrow brings
In this world where everyone's blind? 
And where to go, no matter how far, I'll find
To let you know that you're not alone
Only thing they ever did wrong  was bein' born black, in this white man’s world.
All my ghetto motherfuckers, be proud to be black if you proud to have this shit like this,'cause ain't nobody got it like this.
All these motherfuckers wanna be like us.
They all wanna be like us, to be the have-nots: all hail.
God bless the child that can hold his own, no motherfuckin' doubt.
Bein' born with less, I must confess
Only adds on to the stress
Two gunshots to my homie's head, died in his vest
Shot him to death and left him bleedin' for his family to see
I pass his casket, gently askin', is there a heaven for G's? 
My homeboy's doin' life, his baby mama be stressin'
Sheddin' tears when her son finally ask that questions
Where my daddy at? Mama, why we live so poor? 
Why you cryin'? Heard you late night
Through my bedroom door
Now, do you love me, mama? 
Why they keep on callin' me nigga? 
Get my weight up with my hate
And pay'em back when I'm bigger
And still thuggin' in this jail cell, missin' my block
Hearin' brothers screamin' all night, wishin' they'd stop
Proud to be black, but why we act
Like we don't love ourselves? 
Don't look around, busta,  check yourselves
Know what it means to be black, whether a man or girl
We still strugglin' in this white man's world
Who knows what tomorrow brings
In this world where everyone's blind? 
And where to go, no matter how far, I'll find
To let you know that you're not alone
We must fight for brother Mumia
We must fight for brother Mutulu
And we must fight for brother Ruchell Magee
We must fight for brother Geronimo Pratt
We must fight for , Zulu, 
We must fight for the countless political prisoners
Who are locked up falsely by this white man
So, tell me why you changed to choose a new direction
In the blink of an eye? 
My time away just made perfection
Did you think I'd die? 
Not gon' cry, why should I care? 
Like we holdin' onto lost love that's no longer there
Can you please help me? 
God bless me, please keep my seeds healthy
Makin' all my enemies bleed while my G's wealthy
Hopin' they bury me with ammunitions, weed and shells
Just in case they trip in Heaven—ain't no G's in Hell
Sister, sorry for the pain that I caused your heart
I know I'll change if you help me, but don't fall apart
Rest in peace to Latasha, Lil' Yummy, and Kato
Too much for this cold world to take, ended up bein' fatal
Every woman in America, especially black
Bear with me, can't you see that we under attack? 
I never meant to cause drama to my sister and mama
Hope we make it to better times, in this white man's world
Who knows what tomorrow brings
In this world where everyone's blind? 
And where to go, no matter how far, I'll find
To let you know that you're not alone
You're out of touch with reality! There are a few of you in a few smoke-filled rooms, calling that the mainstream, while the masses of the people—white and black, red, yellow and brown, poor and vulnerable—are suffering in this nation.
Never that, in this white man's world, they can't stop us
We've been here all this time
They ain't took us out, they can never take us out
No matter what they say, about us bein' extinct
About us bein' endangered species
We ain't never gon' leave this
We ain't never gon' walk off this planet
Unless y'all choose to
Use your brain, use your brain
It ain't them that's killin' us, it's us that's killin' us
It ain't them that's knockin' us off
I's us that's knockin' us off
I'm tellin' you better watch it, or be a victim
Be a victim, in this white man's world
Born black, in this white man's world, no doubt
And it's dedicated to my motherfuckin' teachers
Mutulu Shakur, Geronimo Pratt, Mumia Abu Jamal
Sekou Odinga, all the real OG's, we out
The seal, and the constitution, reflect the thinking of the founding fathers, that this was to be a nation by white people; and for white people, Native Americans, Blacks, and all other non-white people were to be the burden bearers, for the real citizens of this nation."
Shit, you mothafuckin' right! 
I'm the bitch that's keepin' it live and keepin' it hot
When you punk-ass niggas don't
Nigga, westside! What? ! Bring it on! 
Look for me, lost in the whirlwind
'96 Bonnie and Clyde, me and my girlfriend
Doing 85 when we ride
Trapped in this world of sin
Born as a ghetto child, raised in this whirlwind
Our childhood years recall the tears, heart laced with venom
Smokin' sherm, drinkin' malt liquor — father, forgive'em
Me and my girlfriend, hustlin'
Fell in love with the struggle
Hands on the steering wheel, blush while she bail out bustin'
Fuck'em all, watch'em fall screamin'
Automatic gunfire exorcisin' all demons
My mafioso messiah, my congregation high, ready to die
We bail out to take the jail back, niggas united
Our first date, couldn't wait to see you naked
Touch you in every secret place
I could hardly wait to bust freely
Got you red-hot, you so happy to see me
Make the front page, prime time, live on TV
Nigga, my girlfriend, baby 45 but she still live
One shot make a nigga's heartbeat stop
What? ! I'm bustin' on you punk-ass niggas
Run, nigga, run! I'm on yo' ass, nigga
Run, nigga! Duck and hide
When I'm bustin' on all you bitches! 
Run, nigga! Yeah, west side! 
Uh! Uh! Uh! Die, nigga, die! 
My girlfriend: blacker than the darkest night
When niggas act bitch-made she got the heart to fight
Nigga, my girlfriend, though we separated at times
I knew deep inside, baby girl would always be mine
Picked you up when you was 9
Started out my life of crime with you
Bought you some shells when you turned 22
I's true, nothin' compares to the satisfaction
That I feel when we out mashin': me and my girlfriend
All I need in this life of sin
Is me and my girlfriend
Down to ride to the bloody end
Just me and my girlfriend
All I need in this life of sin
Is me and my girlfriend
Down to ride to the bloody end
Just me and my girlfriend
I was too immature to understand your ways
Inexperienced back in the days
Caused so many arguments and strays
Now I realize how to treat you, the secret to keep you
Being faithful, ‘cause now cheating's lethal
We're closer than the hands of time
Deeper than the drive of mankind
I trust you dearly, I shoot blind
In time I clock figures, droppin' niggas as we rise
We all soldiers in God's eyes
Now it's time for war; never leave me, baby
I'm paranoid, sleepin' with you loaded by my bedside, crazy
Jealous when you hang with the fellas, I wait patiently alone
Anticipated for the moment you come home
I'm waitin' by the phone, this is true love, I can feel it
I've had a lot of women in my bed, but you the realest
So if you ever need me, call, I'll be there through it all
You're the reason I can stand tall: me and my girlfriend
All I need in this life of sin
Is me and my girlfriend
Down to ride to the bloody end
Just me and my girlfriend
All I need in this life of sin
Is me and my girlfriend
Down to ride to the bloody end
Just me and my girlfriend
I love finger-fuckin' you, all of a sudden I'm hearin' thunder
When you bust a nut, niggas be duckin' or takin' numbers
Love to watch you at a block party, beggin' for drama
While unleashin' on the old-timers, that's on my mama
I would trade my life for yours, behind closed doors
The only girl that I adore, everything I'm askin' for
Talkin' to me, beggin' me to just take you around
Seventeen, like Brandy you just wanna be down
Talkin' loud when I tell you be quiet
You move the crowd, bustin' rounds, activatin' a riot
That's why I love you so, no control, down to roll, unleash
After a hit you, break apart, then back to one piece
Much love to my one and only girlfriend, the world is ours
Just hold me down, baby, witness the power
Never leave a nigga alone, I love you black or chrome
Turn this house into a happy home: me and my girlfriend
All I need in this life of sin
Is me and my girlfriend
Down to ride to the bloody end
Just me and my girlfriend
All I need in this life of sin
Is me and my girlfriend
Down to ride to the bloody end
Just me and my girlfriend
All I need in this life of sin
Me and my girlfriend
Down to ride to the bloody end
Me and my girlfriend
Lost in the whirlwind
'96 Bonnie and Clyde, me and my girlfriend
Doin' 85 when we ride
Trapped in this world of sin
Born as a ghetto child, raised in this whirlwind
Look for me, lost in the whirlwind
'96 Bonnie and Clyde, me and my girlfriend
Doin' 85 when we ride
Trapped in this world of sin
Born as a ghetto child, raised in this whirlwind
Look for me, lost in the whirlwind
'96 Bonnie and Clyde, me and my girlfriend
Doin' 85 when we ride
Trapped in this world of sin
Born as a ghetto child, raised in this whirlwind
Look for me, lost in the whirlwind
'96 Bonnie and Clyde, me and my girlfriend
Look for me, lost in the whirlwind
'96 Bonnie and Clyde, me and my girlfriend
Me and my girlfriend
Yo, Jackson! A 231549
Yeah, close four! Comin' down! 
Crichlow! A 5991301
Close five! Comin' down! 
My homeboys in Clinton and Rikers Island
All the Penitentiaries
Mumia, Mutulu, Geronimo, Sekon
All the political prisoners
San Quentin  
All the jailhouses, I'm with you
Yeah, one thug, one thug
How do we keep the music playin'? 
You're listenin' to the sounds of one thug
One thug, one thug, How do we get ahead? 
You're listenin' to the sounds of…
I wake up early in the mornin', mind state so military
Suckers fantasizin' pictures of a young brother buried
Was it me, the weed, or this life I lead? 
If daytime is for suckers, then tonight we breathe
Out for all that, knowin' that this world bring drawbacks
Look how they shiver once I deliver these raw raps
Meet me at the cemetery, dressed in black
Tonight we honor the dead, those who won't be back
So, if I die, do the same for me, shed no tears
An outlaw thug livin' in this game for years
Why worry? Hope to God, get me high when I'm buried
Knowin' deep inside only a few love me
Don't rush me to the gates of Heaven
Let me picture for a while, how I lived for my days as a child
I wonder now, how do we outlast? 
Always get cash, stay strong if we all mash; hold ya head! 
How do we keep the music playin'? 
Yes, you got to hold ya head! 
How do we get ahead? Hold ya head! 
Too many young black brothers are dyin'
Yes, you got to hold ya head! 
Livin' fast, too fast
These felonies be like prophecies
Beggin' me to stop, ‘cause these
Lawyers gettin' money every time they knock us
Snatchin' pockets lyrically, suckers flee when they notice
Switched my name to Makaveli, half the rap game ghost
Exposed foes with my hocus-pocus flows, they froze
Now suckers idolize my chosen blows
And mo' money mean litigatin', mo' playa hatin'
Got a cell at the pen' for me waitin'—is this my fate? 
Miss me with that misdemeanor thinkin', me fall back? 
Never that, too much Tequila drinkin', we all that
Make them understand me? Hell nah, this ain't my posse
Everyone with me is family, ‘cause everybody's got me
Watch me paint a perfect vision, this life we livin'
Got us all meetin' up in prison
Last week I got a letter from my road dog, written in blood
Sayin', 
Please show a playa love—hold ya head! 
How do we keep the music playin'? 
You got to hold ya head! 
How do we get ahead? Come on, hold ya head! 
Too many young black brothers are dyin'
Yes, hold ya head! 
Livin' fast, too fast
The weed got me tweakin' in my mind, I'm thinkin'…
God bless the child that can hold his own
Indeed, enemies bleed when I hold my chrome
Let these words be the last to my unborn seeds
Hope to raise my young nation in this world of greed
Currency means nothin' if you still ain't free
Money breeds jealousy, take the game from me
I hope for better days, trouble comes naturally
Runnin' from authorities'til they capture me
And my aim is to spread mo' smiles than tears
Utilize lessons learned from my childhood years
Maybe Mama had it all right, rest yo' head
Tradin' conversations all night, bless the dead
To the homies that I used to have that no longer roll
Catch a brother at the crossroads
Plus nobody knows my soul, watchin' time pass
Through the glass of my drop-top Rolls; hold ya head! 
How do we keep the music playin'? 
You got to hold ya head! 
How do we get ahead? C'mon, hold ya head! 
Too many young black brothers are dyin'
Yes, hold ya head! 
Livin' fast, too fast
You got to hold ya head! 
How do we keep the music playin'? 
Yes, you got to hold ya head! 
How do we get ahead? 
No matter how hard it get, feel me? 
Get the weed, drink a drink, read a book
Watch the stars, get some pussy—whatever!
To my niggas that went out in line on duty
21-gun salute! One love, one thug, one nation
21-gun salute! 
21-gun salute!  
All the time I be…
Hopin' my true motherfuckers know
This be the realest shit I ever wrote
Against all odds, up in the studio gettin' blowed
To the truest shit I ever spoke
21-gun salute, dressed in fatigues, black jeans and boots
Disappeared in the crowd, all you seen was troops
This little nigga named Nas think he live like me
Talking'bout he left the hospital, took five like me
You live in fantasies, nigga, I reject your deposit
We shook Dre punk ass, now he out of the closet
Mobb Deep wonder why a nigga blowed'em out
Next time grown folks talk, nigga, close your mouth! 
Peep me, I take this war shit deeply
Done seen too many real players fall
To let these bitch niggas beat me
Puffy, let's be honest, you a punk or you will see me with gloves
Remember that shit you said to Vibe about me bein' a thug? 
And you can tell the people you roll with whatever you want
But you and I know what's goin' on
Payback, I knew you bitch niggas from way back
Witness me strapped with MAC's, knew I wouldn't play that
All you old rappers tryin' to advance
I's all over now, take it like a man
Niggas lookin' like Larry Holmes 
Flabby and sick
Tryin' to player hate on my shit, you eat a fat dick
Let it be known, this is how you made me
Lovin' how I got you niggas crazy
Against all odds, hopin' my thug motherfuckers know
This be the realest shit I ever wrote
Against all odds, up in the studio, gettin' blowed
To the truest shit I ever spoke
Against all odds, hopin' my true motherfuckers know
This be the realest shit I ever wrote
I heard he was light-skinned, stocky, with a Haitian accent
Jewelry, fast cars and he's known for flashin'
Listen while I take you back and lace this rap
A real live tale about a snitch named Haitian Jack
Knew he was workin' for the feds
Same crime, different trials, nigga, picture what he said
And did I mention? 
Promised to payback, Jimmy Henchman, in due time
I know you bitch niggas is listenin', the world is mine
Set me up, wet me up, niggas stuck me up
Heard the guns bust, but you tricks never shut me up
Touch one of mine, on everything I love
I'll destroy everything you touch
Play the game, nigga; all out warfare, eye for eye
Last words to a bitch nigga: 
Why you lie? 
Now you gotta watch your back, now watch your front
Here we come, gunshots to Tut, now you stuck
Fuck the rap game, nigga, this M.O.B.
So believe me, we enemies, I go against all odds
I'm hopin' my true motherfuckers know
This be the realest shit I ever wrote
Against all odds, up in the studio, gettin' blowed
To the truest shit I ever spoke
I'm hopin' my true motherfuckers know
This be the realest shit I ever wrote; against all odds
Puffy gettin' bribed like a bitch, to hide that fact
He did some shit he shouldn't have did, so we ridin' for that
And that nigga that was down for me, restin' dead
Switched sides, guess his new friends wanted him dead
Probably be murdered for the shit that I said
I bring the real, be a legend, breathin' or dead
Lord, listen to me, God don't like ugly, it was written
Ayo, Nas, your whole damn style is bitten
You heard my melody, read about my life in the papers
All my run-ins with authorities, felonious capers
Now you wanna live my life
So what's a 
Hausa,  Nas? Niggas that don't rhyme right
You've seen too many movies
Load'em up against the wall, close his eyes
Since you lie you die — goodbye! 
Let the real live niggas hear the truth from me
What would you do if you was me? Nigga
Hopin' my true motherfuckers know
This be the realest shit I ever wrote
Against all odds, up in the studio gettin' blowed
To the truest shit I ever spoke
Against all odds, hopin' my true motherfuckers know
This be the realest shit I ever wrote
Against all odds, up in the studio gettin' blowed
To the truest shit I ever spoke; against all odds
21-gun salute, one love to my true thug niggas
21-gun salute to my niggas that die in the line of duty
Representin' to the fullest, bein' soldiers with military minds
That play the rules of the game, 21-gun salute
I salute you, my niggas, stay strong
I ride for you, I rhyme for you, I roll for you, it's all for you
To all you bitch-made niggas, I'm comin' for you
Against all odds, I don't care who the fuck you is
You touch me I'm at you
I know you motherfuckers didn't think I forgot
Hell nah, I ain't forgot, nigga
I just remember what you told me
You said don't go to war unless I got my money right
I got my money right now, now I want warThis next one's the first song on our new album...
 People how you doin', there's a new day dawnin'
 For the earth mother, it's a brand new mornin'
 For such a long while, there's been such a longin'
 But now the sun is shinin', let's roll back the awnin'
 Move-move your body
 This is a type of kinda like a formal dedication
 Givin' out a shout
 for much inspiration
 All I ever really want to do is get nice
Get loose and goof a little slice of life
 Sendin' out love to all corners of the land
 I jump up on the stage and take the mic in my hand
 I'm not playin' the roll
 Just being who I am
 And if you try to dis me, I couldn't give a damn
 Cause I'm rockin'
Rockin'
Rockin'
Rock-rock, rockin'
Yeah, get down
Rock-rock, rock on
Rock-rock, rock on
Rock-rock, rock on
Mic-mic, mic control
Mic-mic, mic control
Mic-mic-mic, mic control
Yeah, can you get my drift? 
 Bass from the back of my car feels soothin'
 Eight bazookas is what I'm usin'
 I'm Mike D, and it's been proven
 I love it when I see the party people just movin'
 Strapped on my ear goggles and what did I see? 
 But the music brought the people into harmony
Ahh, for the blacks, Puerto Ricans, and the white people too
Whoahhh-ohhh
Funky boss, funky boss, funky boss, funky boss
Funky boss, funky boss, get off my back 
Funky boss, funky boss, funky boss, funky boss
Funky boss, funky boss, get off my back
What in the fuck is hap-pen-ning? 
Funky boss, funky boss, funky boss, funky boss
Funky boss, funky boss, funky bald-ass boss
Yeah, that's right, funky
Bald motherfuckers!

Be true to yourself and you will never fall

Do what I do professionally
To tell the truth I am exactly what I want to be
Now Ad-Rock  and MCA 
Let's rock this joint in the old school way
Well I’m on'til the crack of dawn
Mowing down emcees like I’m mowing a lawn
I go off like nothing can phase me
You think we'll ever meet Stevie? one of these days, D
But I can stand my ground and I am down
To wax an emcee who acts like a clown
But for now, I’d like to ask you how
You like the feel of the bass in your face in the crowdGood times gone and you missed them
What's gone wrong in your system? 
Things they bounce, like a Spalding
What'd you think? Did you miss your calling? 
I's so free, this kind of feeling
I's like life, it's so appealing
When you've got so much to say
I's called gratitude, and that's right
Good times gone, but you feed it
Hate's grown strong, you feel you need it
Just one thing, do you know you
What you think? That the world owes you? 
What's gonna’ set you free
Look inside and you'll see
When you've got so much to say
I's called gratitude, and that's rightLighten up, gotta lighten up, gotta lighten up right now
Gotta lighten up, gotta lighten up, gotta lighten up right now
Gotta lighten up, gotta lighten up, gotta lighten up right now
Gotta lighten up, gotta lighten up, gotta lighten up
Shine like the sun
Lighten up, gotta lighten up, gotta lighten up right now
Gotta lighten up, gotta lighten up, gotta lighten up right now
Gotta lighten up, gotta lighten up, gotta lighten up right now
Gotta lighten up, gotta lighten up, gotta lighten up
Shine like the sunI's finger lickin', finger lickin' good, y'all
Finger lickin', a finger lickin' good, y'all
I's finger lickin', finger lickin' good, y'all
I's finger lickin', finger lickin' good, y'all
Lickin'-lickin', uh
Lickin'-lickin', uh
Lickin'-lickin', uh
Lickin'-lickin', uh
Well, Mike d, what's up? 
Yo, Yauch what's up? 
Come on, Mike, let's tear it up
Hear no evil, see no evil, talkin' no bullshit
So many damn people are so damn full of it
Keyboard Money Mark, you know he ain't havin' it
Just give him some wood and he'll build you a cabinet
I’m convinced that Vince is rippin' me off
I think it's his girdle that's tippin' me off
Well, Mike D's out back and he's growin' onions
I’ve got bigger buns than my man Paul Bunyon's
I’ve been going nuts gettin' all cooped up
Fully hermitizing but now I’m getting souped up
I's time to turn the page to a brand new chapter
Settin' my sights and you know what I’m after
I’ll be in the paper the news with Ernie Ernesto
They'll even print my recipe for pasta with pesto
Now here's another special of the day
I’ve got more spice than the frugal gourmet
I's finger lickin', finger lickin' good, y'all
Finger lickin', a finger lickin' good, y'all
I's finger lickin', finger lickin' good, y'all

Well, Mike D , what you got for me? 
Show these good people what it means to be D
Well they call me Mike d with the mad man style I put
I put the mic up to my lips and I can scream for a while
Created a sound at which many were shocked at
I’ve got a million ideas that I ain't even rocked yet
I’ve got the light bulb flashing at the top of my head
Never wake up on the wrong side of the bed
You're an idea man, not a yes man
With a point to make, you're bound to take a stand
Cause I’m Pete the Puma, Minnie the Moocher
Got every type of flavor or style that will suit ‘ya
You know the bass is real fat, because it's gotta’ be like that
A snare on the funky tin, and a taste of the high-hat
Finger lickin', finger lickin' good, y'all
Finger lickin', a finger lickin' good, y'all
I's finger lickin', it's finger lickin' good, y'all
A finger lickin', a lickin', lickin' good, y'all
Yo, Yauch what's up? 
Mike D, what's up? 
Come on Yauch, let's tear it up
Well, I could catch a groove like a flash in the dark
I grab a hold of your attention like a thief in the park
‘Cause I can flip a rhyme off the tip of my tongue
Yeah, I be switching up the rhythm like the rhyme's a piece of chewing gum
Now I might chew, but I don't bite
My ideas are mine when I begin to write
In my sleep I’ll be thinking'bout beats and
Getting on the mic and busting some treats and
Sportin’ the crazy funky threads that you've never even seen before
What I’m lackin’ from the mackin’ I can find at the thrift store
I won't scuff nor scuffle, just grin as they walk by
Take time to rhyme for a girl I hear talk fly
Down some papaya, down with the revolution
Always wear my goggles, ‘cause there's so much pollution
I can do the Freak, the Patty Duke, and the Spank
Gotta free the funky fish from the funky fish tanks
I’ll sell my house, sell my car, and I’ll sell all my stuff
I’m going back to New York City, I do believe I’ve had enough
Whipped-whipped-whipped cream
Whipped-whipped-whipped cream
We're gonna’ be out of her in a minute
So this one goes out to my man, Mario C
My brother Adrock, cuttin' it up on the turntable
Yeah, finger lickin' good, y'all
DJ Hurricane is finger lickin' good, y'all
To Mario C, you can't front on that
Well just plug me in just like I was Eddie Harris
You're eating crazy cheese like you would think I'm from Paris
You know I get fly, you think I get high
You know that I'm gone and I'm-a tell you all why
So tell me who are you dissing; maybe I'm missing
The reason that you're smiling or wyling, so listen
In my head, I just want to take'em down
Imagination set loose and I'm gonna shake'em down
Let it flow like a mud-slide
When I get on, I like to ride and glide
I've got depth of perception in my text, y'all
I get props at my mention cause I vex, y'all
So what'cha, what'cha, what'cha want? 
I get so funny with my money that you flaunt
I said, 
Where'd you get your information from,  huh? 
You think that you can front when revelation comes? 
Well they call me Mike D, the ever-loving man
I'm like Spoonie Gee , I'm the metropolitician 
You scream and you holler, about my Chevy Impala
But the sweat is getting wet around the ring around your collar
But like a dream I'm flowing without no stopping
Sweeter than a cherry pie with Reddi Whip topping
Going from mic to mic, kickin' it wall to wall
Well I'll be calling out you people like a casting call
Ah, well, it's wack when you're jacked in the back of a ride
With your know, with your flow, when you're out getting by
Believe me, what you see is what you get
And you see me, I'm coming off as you can bet
Well I think I'm losing my mind, this time
This time I'm losing my mind; that's right
I said I think I'm losing my mind, this time
This time, I'm losing my mind
Yeah, you can't front on that
But little do you know about something that I talk about
I'm tired of driving, it's due time that I walkabout
But in the meantime, I'm wise to the demise
I've got eyes in the back of my head so I realize
Well I'm Dr. Spock, I'm here to rock, y'all
I want you off the wall, if you're playing the wall
I said what'cha, what'cha, what'cha want 
I said what'cha, what'cha, what'cha want 
Y'all suckers write me checks and then they bounce
So I reach into my pocket for the fresh amount
See I'm the long leaner Victor the Cleaner
I'm the illest motherfucker from here to Gardena
Well I'm as cool as a cucumber in a bowl of hot sauce
You've got the rhyme and reason, but got no cause
But if you're hot to trot, you think you're slicker than grease
I've got news for you crews, you'll be sucking like a leech
Yeah, you can't front on that
So what'cha, what'cha, what'cha want 
So what'cha, what'cha, what'cha want 
I said so what'cha, what'cha, what'cha want 
I said so what'cha, what'cha, what'cha want 
From the heart and the mind
And you can kiss my ass, haha
That was the 
M to the 
I to the 
K to the 
E to the 
D y'all
Front on THATBiz Markie - *whispering*
One, two, three...
They are, they comin' home
Oh, they comin' home
To all their fans, they are, they comin' home
They're comin' home, oh, they're comin' home
Yeah, that's right! 
I's tiiiiime, to set the record straight
Ain't nobody got to spell it for me
I said ain't nobody got to yell that can see
I said ain't nobody got to pay that can hear
But if I have to I'll yell in your earrrrrrrr! 
Time for livin, time for givin
Check this out
Ain't nobody got to spell it for me
I said ain't nobody got to yell that can see
I said ain't nobody got to pay that can hear
But if I have to I'll yell in your earrrr! 
Soul fire! ! Soul fire! ! 
And we ain't got no water
We don't got no water
Time for livin', time for givin'
No time for makin' up a monster to sellI wish for peace between the races
Someday we shall all be one
Why fight yourself? 
This one's called Rectify
There's something coming to the surface
There's fire all around
But this is all illusion
I've seen better days than this one
I've seen better nights than this one
Tension is rebuilding
Something's got to give
Something's got to give
Someday, we shall all be one
Jesus Christ, we're niceOur evening began
In Peter Sichel's comfortable study
In his New York townhouse
Where the candlelight was just right
The hi-fi was in the background
And the wine, was delicious
*partying and laughter*
 What's the secret, Peter? 
 Naturally, I'll say it's the wine
 Mmmm, it does go well with the chicken! 
 Delicious again, PeterI don't see things quite the same as I used to
As I live my life, I've got just me to be true to
When I find that I don't know about just what to do
I turn and look within—to see what I should do
Now I'm not sure what it takes to be hip
A lot of people making music that to me ain't shit
So I ask creation for rhymes for this jam
Gimme lickle solo and I'll take the mic stand
Love vibe, love vibe, love vibe, love vibe
Love vibe, love vibe, love vibe, love vibe
Yeah, as the earth spins into a brand new day
I see the light on the horizon's not fading away
Gonna shine from within, like a bright white sun
No need to hide and no place to run
Got the vibrations of the music bringing light to your mind
So you can move and groove, and feel the beat of the time
Sense the power in the air as it starts to move
You get a real good feeling that you just can't lose
Love vibe
Contemplation time
Love vibe
Intuition time
Love vibe
Evolution time
Love vibe
Resolution time
Free your mind, it's time for good times
And let yourself move, it's a time to shine
Spread your wings in the sky, feelin' good inside
Breaking fool with no need to hide
I got the music cuttin' through me
Takin' control of my soul
I can't hold back, I've got to let go
Stand together 
I's about time 
Stand together 
I said it's about time , come on
Stand together 
I said it's about time 
I think we should stand togetherPow!Yo, Paul, this is Al. You can kiss my ass

I feel like Rufus Thomas, the crown prince of dance
I'm Mike D, and I'm known for romance
I'm the crazy baldhead with the part on the side
And I'm riding down the block, like I'm on a water slide
Cause it's the type of day I feel like pressing my luck
Cause I got nothing to lose, cause I don't give a fuck
See I'm a player, I play
Don't play to win, I play to show
Yeah, I am the maestro! 
Ahh, yeah, I need a little bit of cooperation right about now
I'd like to find out who's favorite detective it is

Just how fresh can you get y'all? 
Those that are blessed say yes y'all

Tantalize my tummy with a booboosnack
But now I got to get back

I'm gonna tell you motherfuckers why you ain't shit

And I'mma get my shit together boy
Aww yeah! Gonna, gonna, aww yeah

Aww yeah *whistling*
Okay, that's it for the night folks
I's good to hear y'all out there
Come back next week
We'll have some sheets for ya
Remember on your way home
If you're drivin, don't drink
And if you drink, don't driveGood morning
Time to get up and go to work
I ride on the bus into the city every day
I sit on my seat and I dream myself away
I dream I'm on an island with that foxy lady too
But when I awaken, I must be mistaken, I'm on Third Avenue
Won't you take me away and take away me
Won't you take me away and take away me
Yeaaah
Alright, get off the bus
You're wild man... WILD! 
That's insane, you're stupid
You should sleep late man;
I's just much easier on your constitution"
Yo I don't hang out with those guys, man, I ain't got nothing to do with those dudes.
Wait a minute, I saw your female with'em, too. What's up with her? I've been hearin' that she been givin' that stuff out to ALL them graffiti guys.
Yo, shut the fuck up, Chico, man! 
I could paint three of those murals for some of that ass.
Professor, what's another word for'pirate treasure'? 
Well, I think it's'booty'. Booty, booty, that's what it is.
Yes, I got more bounce than the fucking bump
And then you want to know why
Because I'm motherfuckin' truckin'
I'm in the pocket just like Grady Tate
Got supplies of beats so you don't have to wait
Cause I'm the master blaster, drinking up the shasta
My voice sounds sweet cause it has to
So light a match to my ass cause I'm blowin' up
I'd like to thank the people for just showin' up
But now I want y'all to move it
Put your point on the floor and just prove it
And I'm smurfin', not rehearsin', gettin' live, y'all
A little puffy, so you know what, I'm doin' right
Cause that's the kind of frame of mind I'm in
I got this feelin' that it's back again
So don't touch me, cause I'm electric
And if you touch me, you'll get shocked
You got, you got, you got, you got, you got
You've got the boomin' system, but it's sloshing out doo-doo
You think it's chocolate milk, but it's watered down Yoo-hoo
I've been through many times in which I thought I might lose it
The only thing that saved me, has always been music
We've got our own studio, the Son of the G
I's no question, life's been good to me
Cause life ain't nothing but a good groove
A good mixtape to put you in the right mood
This one goes out to my man, the Groove Merchant
Coming through with beats for which I've been searching
Like two sealed copies, of expansions
I'm like Tom Vu with yachts and mansions
The logo I sport is the face of the monkey
Union made, Ben Davis-quality, it's no junk, see? 
My chrome is shining, just like an icicle
I ride around town in my low-rider bicyle
So many wack emcees, you get the TV bozak
Ain't even gonna call out your names, cause you're so wack
And one big oaf, who's faker than plastic
A dictionary definition of the word spastic
You should have never started something that you couldn't finish
Cause writin' rhymes to me is like Popeye to spinach
I'm bad ass, move ya' fat ass, cause you're wack, son
Dancing around like you think you're Janet Jackson
Thought you could walk on me to get some ground to walk on
I'll put the rug out under your ass as I talk on
I'll take you out like a sniper on a roof
Like an emcee at the fever in the DJ booth
With your headphones strapped, you're rockin' rewind/pause
Tryin' to figure out what you can do to go for yours
But like a pencil to a paper, I got more to come
One after another, you can all get some
So you better take your time, and meditate on your rhyme
Cause your shit'll be stinkin' when I go for mine
And that's right, y'all, don't get uptight, y'all
You can't say shit because you're biting what I write, y'all
And that's wrong, y'all, over the long haul
You can't cut the mustard when you're fronting it allOne, two, three, four...
Now ADRock, and MCA...
Pass the pass the pass the pass the pass the...
I give thanks I give I give I give...
So Mike D so Mike D Mike d...
M.I.K.E. I.K.E....
Rock rock on rock on rock...
I go I go I go...
Feel the bass the bass...Well, it's...
Fifty cups of coffee and you know it's on
I move the crowd to the break of break of dawn
Can't rock the house without the party people
Cause when we're gettin down we are all equal
There's no better or worse between you and me
But I rock the mic so viciously
Like pins and needles and words that sting
At the blink of an eye I will do my thing
I's like a needle in the cartridge when the record spins
Like diggin' down deep in the record bins
Everybody gettin' down make no mistake
Nothing sounds quite like an 8...0...8
Money makin', money money makin 
Super disco, disco breakin'
Money makin', money money makin 
Super disco, disco breakin'
Sometimes I like to brag, sometimes I'm soft spoken
When I'm in Holland I eat the pannenkoeken
The worm is the spice, you bring the sauce
And you can kiss my ass you funky boss
Now that you got what you want, you want more
Well I'll be with the hammer and the nail at your door
With these funky beats I be goin' head huntin'
Shouts to my peeps let me know if you feel something
Cause I can give you all you need
A little beat for the rhythm and some words to read
Let me tell you now that's my favorite shit
And when I got a new rhyme I just say...
So! 
Money makin', money money makin 
Super disco, disco breakin'
Money makin', money money makin 
Super disco disco breakin'
Yo...yo...yo...he-hello...he-hello...yo...hello
He-hello...he-hello...yo...hello
He-hello...he-hello...yo...
Time, time, time, time
I's times like this when I just can't stop
Can't wind your body without the body rock
Got schemes, schematics, blue prints on file
You got to have dreams to make it all worthwhile
So as I take my time and realign
I wonder what it is I hope to find
I don't mean to brag, I don't mean to boast
But I'm intercontinental when I eat French toast
Adrock--woo! --with the New Edition
Gettin' on down for the year 2000
A slight distraction can get you paid
And when it comes to that type shit, I paved the way
BBoys to the early morn
BGirls be rockin' on and on
BGirls to the break of dawn
BBoys be rockin' on and on
Hey...hey
Dogs love me cause I'm crazy sniffable
I bet you never knew, I got the ill peripheral
In your home, I'm cloned, I'm on your headphones
I love it when you spazz out all alone
Cause I'm that fool that broke the key
I'm unlockable so don't check me
I got weight on my shoulders and things on my mind
The sky is falling and I'm fallin' behind
So I synthesize sounds as I patch my brain
Insane mind games move quick like flames
So now I wonder how sometimes you never know
Who be rockin y'all in stere-ereo
In stere-ereo, in stere-ereo, in stereo
Ladies and gentlemen
A no time like the present to work shit out
That's what we're going on and on and on about
I'm not fakin', just makin' beats in the Dungeon
Keep that shit funky cause the odor is pungent
No shame in my game just par for the path
I try to hone my craft because at hand's the task
But I find I'm not playing with a full deck
I'm up to my neck like Toulouse Lautrec
All I want to know is when is checkout time
So I could be in heaven with the rhythm rock rhyme
And when I'm with my man, Shadi Rock, at the gates
We'll be rockin' rhythms over disco breaks
BBoys to the early morn
BGirls be rockin' on and on
BGirls to the break of dawn
BBoys be rockin' on and on, on and on, on and on, on and on...
Hubo una vez un gran rey que tenía muchas tierras, un castillo y también un amor
Hubo una vez un gran rey que tenía muchas tierras, un castillo y también un amor
Hubo una vez un gran rey que tenía muchas tierras, un castillo y también un amor
Hubo una vez un gran rey que tenía muchas tierras, un castillo y también un amorBoom, yeah, the world mash up
Well
Things get hectic quick
From the satellite dish to your joy stick
I's the night of the living cable box
Wires coming up from around the block
Remote control to change the station
But that won't change your situation
Have you seen what I mean
I'm the little gnome that's in your dreams
So I say this rhyme built by design
To take you beyond space and time
Said who is the man making diamonds out of coal
The man pushing buttons on remote control
Re-mote, control
Remote control
Until your back's up against the wall
You never know yourself that much at all
So you've got to share your love with a friend
That's all that you've got left in the end
Living in this city of pure confusion
People mislead by their own illusion
All this action, no satisfaction
We're all linked together like a chain reaction
Play or fold, love is bold
What is the future that will unfold? 
Some like it hot, others like it cold
But we all want to hold the remote control
Re-mote, control
Re-mote, control
Re-mote, control
Re-mote, control
Things get hectic quick
All of the sudden I'm in the thick
Too much drama all around
Distractions booming in sensuround
Like a rainy day's Earth won't sit still
Sliding on down a hill
Sometimes life seems to stall
So never be ungrateful y'all
So I got a little something for your pay per view
Like Don King, I've got the crazy hair do
We've got cameras on Mars on space patrol
Controlled on Earth by remote controlI don't like your attitude, boy
What makes you feel
And why you gotta be
Like you got the right
To look her up and down
What makes this world
So sick and evil? 
I, don't, want to know
What makes you feel
Like you've got whip appeal
Who made you the judge and jury? 
Ain't you never heard of privacy? 
What makes this world
So sick and evil? 
You figure it out
You figure it out
You figure it outLike a flag at half-mast as frames click fast
Not a thing will last as past is past
Like stacks of thoughts that got played and worn
Used over and over till they were tired and torn
Like a broken clock that can't tell time
Like a thick ass book that's filled with wack rhymes
Like a scorching blaze that burned the sand
Like a band that planned and planned and planned
And flew down like a raven in the dark of night
And snatched up the worm helpless to fight
And brought it back to the nest, singing microphone check
One two one two, this is just a test
One two one two, this is just a test
One two one two, this is just a test
Like sand in one hand You can't hold for long
Like scheming on a plan that goes all wrong
I's like fudge and caramel, they're not the same
And it's a shame, all you talk is game
You act like a diamond waiting to be set
In a gold ring, as if, I bet
As time goes by in this give and take
As long as I learn I will make mistakes
Now, what do I want? What do I need? 
Why do I want it? What's in it for me? 
I's the imagery of technology
Is what you get is what you see
Don't worry your mind
When you give it your best
One two one two this is just a test
One two one two, this is just a test
One two one two, this is just a test
Come on-come on, come on-come on
Come on-come on, come on-come on
Come on-come on, come on-come on
Come on-come on, come on-come on
Ready? One... You will do this four times with the left
Four with the right, then eight times with both
Then repeat Ah... Clap your hands...
Chorus:
Body movin', body movin'
A1 sound, and the sound's so soothing
Body movin', body movin'
We be getting down and you know we're Krush Groovin'
Now, let me get some action from the back section
We need body rockin' not perfection
Let your back bone flip but don't slip a disc
And let your spine unwind — just take a risk
I wanna' do the freak until the break of dawn
Tell me party people is that so wrong
The ship is docking, interlockin'
And up-rockin', electro-shocking
We're getting down, computer action
Do the robotic satisfaction
Now all of y'all, ah get off the wall
Have a ball and get involved with
Chorus
Flame on, I'm gone
I'm so sweet like a nice bon bon
Came out rapping when I was born
Mom said rock it'til the break of dawn
Puttin' bodies in motion cause I got the notion
Like Roy Cormier with the coconut lotion
The sound of the music makin' you insane
You can't explain to people this type of mind frame
Like a bottle of Châteauneuf-du-Pape
I'm fine like wine when I start to rap
We need body rockin', not perfection
Let me get some action from the back section
Chorus
Mike D, with the master plan
I said, Ooh my my and Thank you, ma'am
And when I grab the mic you scream,'Ooh, goddamn'
The crème de la crème is who I am
MCA, where have you been
Packed like sardines in the tin
So kick off your shoes and put on your swim fins
'Cause when it comes to quarries I'm known to swim
And Adrock, light up the place
And if you pull my card, you pull the ace
And if you ask me turn up the bass
And if you play defender
I could be your hyperspace... So
Chorus
You will do eight hops on the left, eight on the right
Four left, four right, two left, two right, the one each
Left right, left right. Start and land on the balls of the feet
Left foot... Ready? I's one two three four five"

Well, now, don't you tell me to smile
You stick around, I'll make it worth your while
Got numbers beyond what you can dial
Maybe it's because I'm so versatile
Style, profile
I said it always brings me back when I hear, ooh child
From The Hudson River out to the Nile
I run the marathon'til the very last mile
Well, if you battle me, I will revile
People always saying my style is wild
You've got gall, you've got guile 
To step to me, I’m a rapophile
If you wanna battle, you're in denial
Coming from Uranus to check my style
Go ahead; put my rhymes on trial
Cast you off into exile
Intergalactic planetary, planetary intergalactic
Intergalactic planetary, planetary intergalactic
Jazz and AWOL, that's our team
Step inside the party, disrupt the whole scene
When it comes to beats, well, I'm a fiend
I like my sugar with coffee and cream
Well, I gotta keep it going, keep it going full steam
Too sweet to be sour; too nice to be mean
Well, on the tough guy style, I'm not too keen
Trying to change the world, I will plot and scheme
Mario C likes to keep it clean 
Goin' to shine like a sunbeam
Keep on rapping, cause that's my dream
Got an A from Moe Dee for sticking to themes
Now when it comes to envy, ya'll is green
Jealous of the rhyme and the rhyme routine 
Another dimension, new galaxy

We're from the family tree of old school hip-hop
Kick off your shoes and relax your socks
The rhymes will spread just like a pox
'Cause the music is live, like an electric shock
I am known to do the wop 
Also known for the Flintstone Flop
Tammy D getting biz on the crop 
Beat-see Boys known to let the beat
MMM, D-r-r-rop! 
Do it
Now when I wrote graffiti, my name was Slop
If my rap's soup, my beats is stock
Step from the table when I start to chop
I'm the lumberjack, DJ Adrock
If you try to knock me, you'll get mocked
I'll stir fry you in my wok
Your knees'll start shaking and your fingers pop
Like a pinch on the neck from Mr. Spock

Beatsie Beatsie Beatsie Beatsie Boys gettin live on the spot
Puttin all kinds of shame in the game you got
We keep the party moving to the broad daylight
G-E-T-L-I-V-E, alright
Transhypnotic, robotic, can't stop it
No limits to this style and you know you can't lock it
First you mock it, rock it and then you stock it
But I've got the styles that are always in the pocket
Well, like a bird floating down on a New York breeze
Every thought in the mind is a planted seed
So watch the mind or the thoughts will stack
Before you know it, boomeranging on back
Well I'm the king of Boggle, there is none higher
I get eleven points off the word'quagmire'
Fools can't see me, that's how it is
And that's how I like it and that's my biz
Beatsie-Beatsie Boys gettin' live on the spot
Puttin' all types of shame in the game you got
We keep the party moving to the broad day light
G-e-t-l-i-v-e, alright
Time's an illusion as the moments race by
Too fast to really grasp, though we may try
Deny'til we die, ooh my-my
These thoughts that mislead and then multiply
Well, second by second and minute by minute
I's like lotto, you have to be in it to win it
Shakin' mind breakin' on their own demise
Lies tax to the max and they'll be feeling those vibes
So tell me what you need that you have got
Fiending on power will make your blood clot
It starts with the greed and then goes all wrong
That's why, We can't all just get along
We're all connected like a Lego set
One equals one together like a croquette
Whether we have or have not yet met
Well, it ain't no thing and it ain't no sweat
Beatsie-Beatsie Boys gettin' live on the spot
Puttin' all kinds of shame in the game you got
We keep the party moving to the broad daylight
G-e-t-l-i-v-e, alright
Non-stop hip-hop, non-stop hip-hop
Non-stop hip-hop, non-stop hip-hop
Well, you're caught in a panic and it's rattled your brain
The selfish ways just can't maintain
But these are the breaks when you try and come fake
Don't come with the rhymes that you just half baked
Well I'm the Benihana chef on the SP12
I chop the fuck out the beats left on the shelf
You be like'Hello Nasty, where you been? '
I's time you brought the grimy beats out the dungeon
I jumped outside the house with my Walkman on
I get so hyped when I hear this song
I's gonna keep me happy like all day long
So go and talk shit cause it just makes me strong
Don't grease my palms with your filthy cash
Multinationals spreading like a rash
I might stick around or I might be a fad
But I won't sell my songs for no TV ad
Beatsie-Beatsie-Beatsie-Beatsie Boys gettin' live on the spot
Puttin' all kinds of shame in the game you got
We keep the party moving to the broad day light
G-e-t-l-i-v-e, alright
Our sound is the nicest, it's the sweetest sound
Our sound is the nicest, it's the sweetest sound
Can't get enough of that f-f-funk
Can't get enough of that f-funk
Can't get enough of that f-f-funk
Can't get enough of that f-funk
Junior...
I'm flowing prose to cons and cons to pros
I'm scheming rhyme against reason like it was flow against know
But beyond the concepts and emotions that rise
To the interconnectedness that underlies
The lies upon lies have lost their meaning
The plies upon plies of consciousness that is being
Over and over, I fall, I learned to walk from a crawl
I's not sad, it's just the way and the purpose of it all
Now every word that you heard that I said that you felt
Was put in place in the space as they were shuffled and dealt
I steal feels from reels, but I pay my respects
Paying compliments and disses and deciphering affects
Words are water as I court her, as she is pristine
Words and mics fall to dust and all that's left is the feelings
I give in and I win, I try to never complain
Intentions venture to center and then they set the stage
But I'll remain sane, making gain without pain
Staining trains with names and driving lanes to the refrain
And keep it positive as painstaking as it is
I'll never turn back cause that's the way I've got to live
I'll never turn back cause that's the way I've got to live
I'll never turn back cause that's the way I've got to live
So like a cloud carries rain, I'm gonna carry my rhyme
Coming like thunder with lightening timing
No hesitation in gestation of thoughts and plans
Ferment time like wine, no ploys or scams
Like the islands dot the oceans in the endless seas
Ideas coming to me in answer to my pleas
Woke up this morning right out of a dream
Reached for my pen and pad because my mind was on a rhyme scheme
What can I do with these bones and flesh? 
With these animated thoughts in a world repressed? 
I'm going down like the rhythms on the winds of change
I'm keeping calm under pressure like a deep-sea range
I'm flowing prose to cons and cons to pros
I'm like Toucan Sam when I follow my nose
I'm giving shouts to Gandhi, Garvey, and King
His Holiness and all enlightened beings
I'll be the one who screams it on the microphone
I'll be the one who brings it inside your home
But the words ain't mine, I just pass'em along
For Betty Williams and her friends, I sing this song
And more ink from my pen and more tears from my eyes
And more crimes are committed as I say these lines
Youth enough, we put down the gunOnce again, I'm all wrapped up in me
My best friend's my own worst enemy
Electricity and gravity
Oh, my god, now take a look at me
My lifeline's run by AT&T
They got their wires all up in me
Is push and pull the way it's got to be? 
Once again, I'm all wrapped up in me
My best friend's my own worst enemy
Electricity and gravity
Once again, I'm all wrapped up in me
Once again, I'm all wrapped up in me
Once again, I'm all wrapped up in me
Once again, I'm all wrapped up in me
You know, I wish that there was some way
That I could be outside playing basketball in the rain
And not get wet. Now wouldn't that be great, hmm?
Cause nobody can do it like Mix Master can
Come on
I've got the D double-O D double-O style
Here we go again because it's been a while
Do me a favor, don't touch that dial
I rock from Manhattan to the Miracle Mile
My name's Mike D, and I'm the ladies choice
I wanna' get next to you like Rose Royce 
Y'all gather round to hear my golden voice
Cause when its time to rhyme, you know I get noice 
Cruising like a fan boat on the glade
He'll tweak your ass across the cross fade
So watch your back when he takes the stage  
Or he'll send you off on a naked rampage
Three MC's and one DJ
We be getting down with no delay
Mix Master Mike, what'cha got to say? 
Sweet and sour like a tangerine
Fresh like a box of Krispy Kremes
Kenny Rogers' 
Gambler is my gambling theme
Mix Master Mike with the scratch routine
Always updated and in the know 
You know we break it down going toe to toe
The bass is booming from down below
And Norton is chillin with Mario 
Well, my name is Adrock, I'm a Scorpio
Don't ask me cause I just don't know
I'm known to mop, I'm known to glow 
But don't get mad cause I gots to go

Giving the neighborhood niggas love

Thicker
Neighborhood clubs beat him up and crackheads be selling tvs and vcrs
For forty bucks so what's up
Yesterday the homey committed a bank caper
Saw the chase on the news and read the story in today's paper
His little girl's just now taking training wheels off her bike
While her daddy's got twenty-five to life at Fort Strike
The little homey just tripped and stripped
Because he didn't realize that the joint was dipped

To fade...
As I walk through the valley of the shadow of death
I take a look at my life and realize there's nothin' left
‘Cause I've been blastin' and laughin' so long
That even my momma thinks that my mind is gone
But I ain't never crossed a man that didn't deserve it
Me be treated like a punk, you know that's unheard of
You better watch how you talkin' and where you walkin'
Or you and your homies might be lined in chalk
I really hate to trip, but I gotta loc
As they croak, I see myself in the pistol smoke
Fool, I'm the kinda G that little homies wanna be like
On my knees in the night, sayin' prayers in the street light
Keep spending most our lives
Livin' in a gangsta's paradise
Been spending most their lives
Livin' in a gangsta's paradise
We keep spending most our lives
Livin' in a gangsta's paradise
We keep spending most our lives
Livin' in a gangsta's paradise
Look at the situation they got me facin'
I can't live a normal life, I was raised by the street
So I gotta be down with the hood team
Too much television watching, got me chasing dreams
I'm a educated fool with money on my mind
Got my ten in my hand and a gleam in my eye
I'm a loc'd out gangsta, set trippin' banger
And my homies are down, so don't arouse my anger
Fool, death ain't nothin' but a heart beat away
I'm livin' life do or die, what can I say? 
I'm 23 now, will I live to see 24? 
The way things is going I don't know
Tell me why are we so blind to see
That the ones we hurt are you and me? 
Keep spending most our lives
Livin' in a gangsta's paradise
Been spending most their lives
Livin' in a gangsta's paradise
We keep spending most our lives
Livin' in a gangsta's paradise
We keep spending most our lives
Livin' in a gangsta's paradise
Power and the money, money and the power
Minute after minute, hour after hour
Everybody's running, but half of them ain't lookin'
I's going on in the kitchen, but I don't know what's cookin'
They say I gotta learn, but nobody's here to teach me
If they can't understand it, how can they reach me? 
I guess they can't, I guess they won't
I guess they front; that's why I know my life is out of luck, fool! 
Keep spending most our lives
Livin' in a gangsta's paradise
Been spending most their lives
Livin' in a gangsta's paradise
We keep spending most our lives
Livin' in a gangsta's paradise
We keep spending most our lives
Livin' in a gangsta's paradise
Tell me why are we so blind to see
That the ones we hurt are you and me? 
Tell me why are we so blind to see
That the ones we hurt are you and me?
Everybody listen up cause I'm about to get my speak on
Fools be trippin when it's time to get their freak on
Runnin round town, puttin it down with-out
No protection, for they erection
When it's time for selection what's your direction? 
Before you make a choice, you betta do some inspection
If you don't know my aim and don't know my game, then
Let me explain now
Iesha slept wit Mark and Mark slept wit Tina
And Tina slept wit Javier the first time he seen her
Javier slept wit Lupe and Lupe slept with Rob
Cuz he was rollin on beads and had a good ass job
Rob slept wit Lisa who slept wit Steve and
Steve was positive, H.I.V
What started off as a plan ended up in the plot
Ya betta cool ya ass off cause it's too damn hot
Oh-ohh it's too hot, *too hot*, too hot lady *too hot*
Gotta run for shelter, gotta run for shade
I's too hot, *too hot*, too hot homie *too hot*
Gotta make some sense, from this mess that we made
You're doin everything momma told ya not to do
Now you're tryin to walk away cause ya know it's true
Your sister can't explain, and your brother's ashamed
To admit you both have the same last name
I don't have to ask you where you've been
Cause the matches in your purse say Holiday Inn
A mind is a terrible thing to waste that was the slogan
But now it's ninety-five and it's 
Don't forget the Trojan
Explained it to her momma, before somebody get her
Gotta hip her to the game of those smooth talkin niggas
Love is the word, seldom meant but often heard
Latex safe sex you better learn
Or get hip to the facts before you react or
End up in a box on your back
Sometimes you ask for what you want and, get what you got
Don't get caught up in the plot, it's too damn hot
Another day in the city and, oh what a pity
Even though we did our duty things are still lookin shitty
Everybody in the pack stacked, tryin to make some scratch
Walkin in the rain but they ain't got no hat
Understand how we livin in the nineties loc
Nuclear waste, cannibalism, and pistol smoke
Sex lies videotape and rape
Just a little bump n grind can seal your fate
We need to do something drastic, shit is gettin tragic
And if you don't believe me, then go ask Magic
Everybody an they momma preachin abstinence, these
Kids ain't checkin for absti-shit
So put a condom in they hand and hope it don't bust
Another victim of the lust, in God we trust
What started off as a plan ended up in the plot
Water can't cool it off cause it's too damn hot
I love it when we're cruisin' together
I love it when we're cruisin' together
Baby get in we fixin' to cruise till we can't

To see if I can get your attention

Just a little additive to your education
I live my life by the code of the funk
600 watt amps, 18's in the trunk
When I'm on the street, you gotta feel my beat, so

Double O, L, I, O with the flow
I'm lookin' for the party, so let a nigga know
1 2 3, it's like A B C
If hip hop didn't pay, I'd rap for free
Slide, slide, but that's that past
I got sumpin' brand new for that ass
If you got beef, then nigga eat a pork chop
Once I get it goin', you know it don't stop
I break like anti-locks, panties drop
From hood to hood, block to block
Help, I need somebody
To get it goin' on in this party
Baby you can do it, take your time do it right
We can drink some yak and do it all damn night
My name ain't Wanda, but I'll rock your world

Grab your partner, do se do

Slide, slide, but that's the past

But don't step on my toes cuz you might get smushed
I's the brother from around the way
And what I say I been comin' on three like Dr. Dre
Comin' at'em with pattern an' a fresh pair of atoms
I hope you don't trip cuz I don't want to have to gat'em
So move your body baby, drive the homeys crazy
The way you shake that ass, always amaze me
Ain't no party like a west coast party
Cuz a west coast party don't stop
So when you see a young nigga
In a Chevy hittin' switches, then you gotta give the nigga his props

Slide, slide, but that's the past
I got sumpin' brand new for that ass
You got me smilin'
Again you
Got me smilin again
Smilin'
Again you
Got me smilin', again
One night of pleasure nine months of pain
Three days later and that's when you came
Two arms two legs ten fingers ten toes
Brown eyes like mom, with your grandmothers nose
Even though you're momma's baby
And daddy's little baby
My love is unconditional to one of us is swayze
Day or night, roll the light
No matter what you do
Like the Jackson 5 said I'll be there for you coz
My life is your life and your life is mine
To thinkin'en I'm your friend'til the end of time
I'll make sure you get your props
You can call me pops
And anything you need I'll pull it out of the stops
Even though we're not together like we used to be
DADDY, you can count on me
Coz when I'm feelin' down every now and then
I take a look into your eyes and then smile again
Forget about Batman, Superman and the Power Rangers
Coz I'mma be your hero if you ever in some danger
This ain't the huxtables and my name ain't Cliff
No matter how old you get you could get that ass whipped
Daddy don't take no mess
And I ain't gone settle for nothing less than your very best
When I do what I do coz you did what you did
I's coz I ain't the kind of father that be raising no dum-ass kids
You gosta be a leader, it's my responsiblity to teach ya
Right from wrong, and make decisions of your own
I never said that I was perfect
But I know that you're worth it so
I'ma do my damnest to make sure you get some chances
So just listen to your daddy coz he tryin to tell ya something
And don't let nobody tell ya I don't love ya coz they frontin'
Coz when I'm feelin' down every now and then
I take a look into your eyes and then smile again
Every day is a struggle when life is like a puzzle
That we gotta put together
Together so and ever
You need a shoulder to cry on and someone you can rely on
Your daddy's home
I'm tryin'a build a foundation on which you could stand
When you's a grown woman and you's a grown man
I got open ears when the world ain't tryin' hear
When I can't be there in the flesh I be there in the spir-it
I'm tryina make an impression on the things that you care for
The knowledge that I give, you could teach your kids
I know it's hard growing up coz I used to be a youngsta
So we don't work as a team, saw the liquor take us under
People let me tell ya about my best friends
Coz I'm down with the children all the way'til the end
Coz when I'm feelin' down every now and then
I take a look into their eyes and then smile again
Got kinda high and uhh kinda drunk
Beer drinkin, beer-beer drinkin, eight ball
I'm sittin' at the bar with a hundred dollar bill
The homies is runnin' late so I got some time to kill
I'm peepin' out this freak in the booth in the corner
I think I seen her rollin a Noble, nosin under and moanin
Two hookers walked in and they was lookin' for a vic
But they, kept on passin' me by coz they can recognize a trick
Twenty minutes later and two double shots of yak
I take a look up at the clock, now where the FUCK the homies at
I feel my pagers on my hipbone, who could it be
Cuz I done talked to everybody that I was'sposed to see
Hahaa!  Now I know, the story is told
And I don't even call'em back cuz they don't know the homie cold
I recieved a page my niggers from the phone in the back
I got a wink from a fine ass sista dressed in black
Another double shout of yak and now the room is spinnin'
But that's only the beginning, god damn! 
I take a walk out to the front to get myself some air and
See if I see the homies, but they still ain't there
There's a fool outside drunk and he want to get into it
I was strapped I coulda killed him, but I didn't do it
I opted for the walk-away, watch the busta talk away
So mister policeman, you can put your chalk away
I mobb back in the club, and, kick it at my table
Cause, niggas be acting stupid, and stupid shit is fatal
The homies is hella late, and now I'm startin' to think
Homegirl that gave me the wink from earlier just bought me a drink
She's sittin' at a stool at the other side of the bar
Doing tricks with her tounge and a cherry like a porno star
The club is gettin' packed and the party is jumpin
Another double shot of yak and I'm on the dancefloor bumpin'
She's licking in my ear and, now I'm feeling faded
I's 11:35 and the homies still ain't made it
Now I'm on the dance floor with baby and, shit is gettin' hectic
The big homey done erected, damn I've been affected
By the funk in the boom and the booty in the room
This ain't the Commodores but this Brick House got me on zoom
Now I'm mackin and struttin and asking baby wassup
My name ain't Everlast, but I can still make you jump
Let's, hope in the Q and go somewhere and kick it like some Trojans
We can do a little drinkin, and do a little smoking
When all of a sudden I start sweatin', my stomach starts bubblin'
I hear earl coming, I think I'm in trouble *vomit sounds*
Ahh shit, I got baby on her titties
I guess there go my chances of gettin with her kitty
I turn around and stumble away and there go the homies with
Long ass trenchcoats on, laughing, sippin on 40's
Now I'm in the back of my own car curled up like a punk
Cuz I got too high and uhh, got too drunk
Now I done use the word bitch a few times in a rhyme
But now it's'95 so let me drop a line
This goes out to the young Black queens
On the neighborhood scene who haven't lost their dream
I know sometimes it seems like it ain't no love
And to get where you go ya got to push and shove
Around the way girl with hope in your heart
Deuce-five in the purse and five in the start
She's the kinda woman ya take home to mama
The only kind you ever let get past the drama
Coolio know that you ain't no ho
And it's time to put you up on a pedestal seat
Queen of the entire universe
And you know how I know that you were put here first
To every nigga that dissed ya and every nigga that hit ya
Accept my apologies for my brothas, my sista
Give it up for my sistas
Give it up for my sistas
Give it up for my sistas
You're all I need
Princess of the Nile, sweet black sexy child
Ooh, I like your style, huh
First mother on the planet, I know it's gettin' scary
And all these wannabe pimps is all that ya meet
But ya gotta shake'em off like fleas and nigga meat
And use your God-given talents and abilities
No matter where ya from ya get much respect
From the top of your neck to your county check
I see ya waitin' for the bus in the early morn
Brick house with a face like Leena Horne
I ain't no cap to save a ho but I got your front
And your side and your back if that's what ya want
So when it's time to put it down, I won't be runnin'
Ya got a dear lil' somethin' like Harriet Tubman, huh
No matter what ya do or where ya go
Ya got love from a nigga named Coolio
My sista
Give it up for my sistas
Give it up for my sistas
Give it up for my sistas
You're all I need
Hernie Dipp got the lips, finger tips, and the hips
To make mice outta the crazy-ass Bloods and Crips
Make a nigga sing a song all night long
'Til his voice is gone with no music on
You can be a busta on a hard-ass low
And should be down with your ass when your poor and broke
And um uh, every time ya need I'll owe ya
Gotta do is make a phone call, cause
When ya say'come' ya know she's on her way
With no hesitance and any type of delay
I talk about my granny, Batana, and Vanita
Jackie and Nicole and Grandy and Artisha
I gots to give credit where credit is due
And all credit that is credited is credit to you
I give praise to your ways and for all my day
Apologies much respect to the sons I raise
My sista
Give it up for my sistas
Give it up for my sistas
Give it up for my sistas
You're all I need
Yeah, 1996
Coolio with the flow
Rated R 
L.V., that's right
Mossberg Smith & Wesson
Forty-five let me tell you how I learned my lesson
House party in the hood at some niggas I don't know
But I had to go they had a house full of hoes
I stepped into that party with my nigga high off that head
The hoes is looking good so we try to make a friend for night
Let's get it right let's get it straight
But now these punk ass niggas in the party want to play a hate
I'd bust a cap to save a rat so what's up with that
I's 1996 so these bustas get no kinda of doubt
Like American Express here we go again
I never leave home without it so don't even think about it
Just let me leave and I won't have to make you bleed
But if you make an offensive move then I'm gonna have to show a groove
Back up off let's keep it soft
Don't make me have to show you who these 16 bosses be
This really ain't me no more
These streets won't let me go
I can't escape this life
That they got me trapped inside
This really ain't me no more
These streets won't let me go
I can't escape this life
That they got me trapped inside
Way back in the days we dudes don't forget a name
Now everybody wants the fame but things change ain't the same
All these sucker set-trippin' killin' for no reason
That's why I never leave the house without my nina
I love my baby carry my baby whereever I go
For these suckers get in a twist they say I beat their pimpin
Stop wishin you was in my shoes
And learn to be yourself stop acting like somebody else
I's ninety-six and most of the homeys thinking of six feet
The six I found out if you wear partners where the friends go
Every week you don't see me I gotta put at work
I guess the shit don't stop till my gaskets drop
Stop hating my life and get your own
Be true to this game or this game will do you cold
Everywhere I go I got my back
I hate to do my all black but I must stay strapped
This really ain't me no more
These streets won't let me go
I can't escape this life
That they got me trapped inside
This really ain't me no more
These streets won't let me go
I can't escape this life
That they got me trapped inside
No no oooo I can't escape this life
I been trying to live in peace but these fools won't cease
They insist with their bullshit so I got a full clip
Chitty-chitty bang-bang doin it's a new thing
One shot from a Jake.38 can make your brain ache
I'm the kinda nigga that don't believe in frontin'
But if you run up on me trippin' you best believe I'm dumpin'
I got bills to pay and kids to raise
And a whole generation of lost niggas to save
So I ain't got time for that yip yap
If you start some static I'm gonna have to blow your mind back
Believe that nigga daisy if you do it's true
Fuck with Coo you get done that's how we do it to it
Don't start no shit and it won't be none son
But if you do I'm going for my gun
Like Doc Holliday a nigga ain't scary
So if you want to trip then I'll be your huckleberry
This really ain't me no more
These streets won't let me go
I can't escape this life
That they got me trapped inside
This really ain't me no more
These streets won't let me go
I can't escape this life
That they got me trapped inside
This really ain't me no more
These streets won't let me go
I can't escape this life
That they got me trapped inside
This really really really ain't me
But the streets won't let me go
I can't escape this life
That they got me trapped insideWe meet every single day at the same old place
At the same old time
With the same state of mind
Me and her together but we know it ain't forever
We just happy for the time
The weed and the wine
The walks in the park, escapades in the dark
We knew how it had to be right
From the very start coz
I got obligations and she's in the situation
That she came to state, so this is our fate
Holding hands, a smile, a glimpse
A kiss and a dance but we can't take a chance on
Gettin caught
So we stick to a plan coz
We both got another and they wouldn't understand it
Me and Mrs Jones have a thing going on
I wouldn't call it love but it damn sure strong
It ain't about doin' dirt
Or living like a flirt
But what they don't know don't hurt
Me and Mrs Jones
-Chorus-
Me and Mrs Mrs Mrs Mrs Jones
Mrs Jones Mrs Jones Mrs Jones
Me and Mrs Mrs Mrs Mrs Jones
Mrs Jones Mrs Jones Mrs Jones
The very first time I met her I
Saw her from across the room
And just when we be both but can't consume
By the thought
Of she and I being together so I
Headed in her direction for some closer inspection
I intentionally brushed her hand her
Skin had a satin touch
The feeling she gave me was
More than I could measure and
Right away I
Knew I had to have her with me
If not with me then maybe just to hit me
She got ten point skill and percision in the walk
And the way that she talk
Make my mouth turn to chalk
She give me everything that I don't get at home
And it seems like I'm a man coz her's is always gone, now
Tell me what love got to do with it
No coz we both feel good when we kickin' it
Some might say that I'm    and should leave her alone
But me and Mrs Jones got a thang goin' on
-Chorus-
Me and Mrs Mrs Mrs Mrs Jones
Mrs Jones Mrs Jones Mrs Jones
Me and Mrs Mrs Mrs Mrs Jones
Mrs Jones Mrs Jones Mrs Jones
I's been about a year since we've been seeing eachother
And we're a whole lot more than just part time lovers
Coz when I got a problem she do everything she can to solve'em
But her life is not revolved around how revolving
I'm the Shaka Zulu and she's my fantasie, but
Deep down inside we know that we can never be
Any more than what we are, a phone call in the car
Bite to eat, with a movie and a drink at the bar
When all of a sudden right out of the blue my
Ladie got a clue on
What what we was up to and
Wait a minute, damn
From what I understand
It seems that my woman's been talking to her man
Since we both in love with the people at home
It looks like, we just gone have to leave it alone
Coz I got a woman and she got a man so
That's how it goes, and that's how it is
-Chorus-
Me and Mrs Mrs Mrs Mrs Jones
Mrs Jones Mrs Jones Mrs Jones
Me and Mrs Mrs Mrs Mrs Jones
Mrs Jones, oh yeah
We used to meet at the same place
Same time
Used to sit and talk it over
Talk it over
Me and Mrs Jones, Mrs Jones
Mrs Jones Mrs JonesStarlight
Starbright
First star I see tonight
I wish I may
I wish I might
Get this lick I try to hit tonight....
Shinin' down on me
Shinin' down on me
Shinin' down on me
Shinin' down on me
Shinin' down on me
Shinin' down on me
Everytime I think about it I still can't understand
What make these niggas think they don't need a plan
Cuz if you don't have a plan, then
Tell me what you got
For your get rich quick scheme
A buster-ass plot
Niggas be punkin' out, loc
Dyin' over nothin'
I's the ghetto witch doctor with another loco potion
Hickory
Dickory
Thievery
Trickery
Poverty
Misery
Pleads to insanity
Homocide
Robbery
Grand theft
Burglary
Perjury
Emergency surgery
A.P.B
They lookin' for a G
You ran through a field
Hopped a fence
And climbed a tree
9-1-1
Here they come, come
Nigga wit' a gun
Now your ass is done
Ain't nowhere to hide
Ain't nowhere to run
Cuz the helicopter light's as bright as the sun....
Shinin' down on me
Shinin' down on me
Shinin' down on me
Bright as the sun
Shinin' down on me
Shinin' down on me
Shinin' down on me
Bright as the sun
It seems nowadays
Just to get some respect
Ya gots to roll a Lex and collect a fat check
Or come around the corner on three, hoppin'
Blockin' up the street
Flossy Mac on your D's
An' everybody sayin' you're the man, loc
Never broke
An' high off that premo smoke
Sippin' in the sea
Rollin' in the ragtop Chevy'63
The p-i-m-p
On top of the game
But now you're gettin' lame
Cuz the yak, weed, and yayo's playin' tricks on your brain
You're lookin' for a way out
Before your game play out
Cuz once you game play out
Ya lose all ya' kriz out
Late one night you was rollin' down the block
With a half a pint of yak and the twenty dollar rock
One time got behind you and they told you to stop
But you kept rollin' cuz ya said you wasn't goin'
Out like a sucka
You dumb mothafucka
Now the chase is on
An' here go the song
How in the hell do you think you can run
When the helicopter light's as bright as the sun
-Chorus-
Lockdown since the'80s
Situation number three
A nigga is released from the penitentiary
Fools betta recognize
An' visualize
Don't be suprized
Ya betta realize
They got a plan fo' your ass
A gauge for the mass, so
If you're rollin' dirty, then you betta have a stash
Spot in your whoopty
An' know the whoompty whoofty
When the whoompty whafty is done unto you, see
He don't know the new game
'Cuz the new game ain't true game
But he betta catch up quick
Becuz the old game is rank
Nine is his waist
That's the new game loc, cuz
If you ain't heated then you might get smoked
He was walkin' down the street
Mindin' his business
Just happy to be free
And what do we see? 
From the corner of his eye
Here come one time
So off he dashed
Like they set fire to his ass
Cuz if he get caught
I's strike number three
An' this might be his last day on the street
I bet ya next time you'll listen when I tell ya, son
That the helicopter light's as bright as the sun
I'm seein' bodiez in the alley and blood in the valley
From the shores of Maine all the way to Compton Cali
I'm callin' rally to the homies in the street light
Take a real close at what it look like
A young nigga in the ghetto raised up on grift
The first thing momma told him was don't take no shit
Playin tag with body bag
Bullets
And bloody rag
And did you put the dodge on the toe tag? 
Whoever the man today, might not be the man tomarrow
Cuz life is full of hardships, pimpslaps, and sorrow
Ya gotta believe in something, but whatever ya do
Make sure what you believe is real and true
Fuck the liez an' alibiez an' come to realize
My vision won't assault of wasted on blind lil' eyes
Like A T an' T ya gotta make a switch
When the Revolution come I'm gonna be up front
With my finga on the trigga of a Mossburg Pump
When the Revolution come I'm gonna be right there
With my nine in my hand and braids in my hair
I've been hollerin' and hoopin' yeah
Lootin' an' shootin'
I'm doin' some recruitin' to bring mo' troops in
Niggas don't be doin' what they'posed to do
They betta post on the corna with the busta crew
Playin' games I used to play back in'79
With the same bullshit an' the same ol' lie
If you want some respect ya won't be individual
On the nigga nuts cuz he rollin' in the Sixty-fo'
Yo favorite line is fuck all a y'all
But one day there's gonna be a final call
That's why I'm rollin' deep in the motherfuckin' Jeep
Always on the peep an' my crew don't fall asleep
So pull your money outa your pocket an' put it in the middle
This ain't no roosta ass Chicken George nigga on a fiddle, huh
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust
In my mothafuckin' self I trust....
Way back in the dayz we used to sling'em in the street
But now when niggas get beat
They wanna go an' get their heat
Everybody know that you know how to kill
But tell me do you how to let a nigga live
I gotta dream that maybe one day
Niggas can't fight then walk away
I'm talkin' fist to cuff with them pistols up, an'
Shoot'em from the shoulders
To show them you can hold your
I sing the song of the fight of the black man
In America
In a state of hysteria
No longa will I accept the second rate
I plan to set the record straight b'fore I disobey
Its the one - two combination punch to the throat
There's a hole in ya boat bitch
That's all she wrote
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust
In my mothafuckin' self I trust....
Steppin up out the shadows I comes equipped to wreck
Hold up just a sec Coolio I'm on deck 
Yeap the diction is on point
Causin, friction when I flex up the jaw to hit the joint
That can actually give a blood mob like Gotti
Like the body cool, keep the strap up by the naughties
Niggie trippin why you beam us I don't step up with no bullshit
See that there it's clip for this stickup on the hip
Peep the correct way to get your pimp on
Let me hit the bong oh and my mind's quite strong
Wreck it nice and proper if it's on I'm finsta to stop her
If I'm swingin for the knockout, best believe I'm fits to drop her
Ninety-five's on poppin, representin I keep stompin
Throw up my fists just like this when I'm mobbin
I killed the last, killed the ass, with my ninety-five drive
I'm deep like Denzel with my Crimson Tide, nigga
Like Chaka Khan, I tell you something good
I'm Hi-C like Spike Lee within Tales From the Hood
You need it, I'll feed it, baby check the size
Have you Goin' Down like Mary J. Blige
When it's poppin like this, you can't be a coward
Shorty freaks fuckin beats like Adina Howard
My squad is hard, with players, and hustlers
No toleration, for fakers and busters
Fuckin with me with all honesty
You get bombed rap songs comin constantly
Bumpin G-15's, Westside scene
Killin the competition, while making a fuckin green
So ring, around the rosie, and mosey to the Rosie
And I want you to know G
We bust and cuss and kick up dust
Don't none of y'all niggas want to fuck with us
So what's the time?  I's time to get real
Why you bust your rhyme?  Cause I got skills
We bust and cuss and kick up dust
Don't none of y'all niggas want to fuck with us
So what's the time?  I's time to get real
Why you bust your rhyme?  Cause that's how I bail
Watch me, swallow this nickel and shit five pennies
I'm the loc'est of them all though the rat is kinda skinny
How many linny and squidgy think they can see me? 
I'm from Compton where even in the summer niggas wear beanies
Bustin lyrics sharper than razor blades catch it from head to toe
If you're shocked, then amazed, when you see me at my stage show
For my stage show beat em up
40 Thevz gettin busy rockin coast to coast
Dogs the most rap the hoes then rocks em up
Givin it up for hip-hop vicitims how should I drop em and then pop em
For poppin like to get what I got, and I ain't got a whole lot of nuthin
Cuz I been ruffin and scuffin so give it up when I'm bustin or get to duckin
Cuz I ain't given em nuthin
Fools can't get none, so fuck em! 
Let me rock the motherfuckin mic
Smoke a whole stick of dynamite, then fight all night
I got jabs like a welterweight champion
The pocket-pincher purse-snatcher pistol-packin
Quick to get it crackin
Went from jackin to rappin to runnin with a pack of mad men
Pull a trick out my sleeve like Aladdin
Some fool tried to play me for a punk I had to have him like
Lunch or dinner, he's just a beginner
Fuckin with a winner, number one contender top dog
Head nigga in charge runnin with a group of hogs
40 Thevz, MAAD Circle, Cat, and Crowbar
Best to put your daughter
Wack ass rappers get tossed up
Trying to come in here with that garbage
My crew see the dopest and the hardest
So clear the path or get your punk ass Bogart-ed
I peep game and get recognized, buyin all the hard liquor
Toothpick and beedy-dyin
Bitch you got dealt, peeled your cap the other way
Like a reversible Louis-Vitton Gucci belt
And ain't nothin crackin
For them niggas steppin up with the funk I'm packin Tinactin
Cause I be earnin stripes in tight bunches
All the homies carry nines I carry rhymes in sucker punches
What?  Tootsie, my knees don't bend
Just like that actor Hoffman I be Dustin off men often
Jaywalkin over your coffin with an eleven shot loss and
John wrecked that Austin won't soften you're lost and
See arson, to exterminate the flyest nigga like Orkin
Stalkin lofts men to New York and in between
So take caution, leave the flossin for dental hygeine
Mental plus my gene equals nasty young bastard
The raps be lung mastered takin vinyl's virginity
Coincidentally I run shit like Walter Payton
Niggas player hatin cause I spoke like a Dayton
I kick the bass like Ron Carter at the Carter when
CMB came strollin
Blowin niggas up like when Mookie's stupid ass got caught smokin
Figure, your stigma is lack of enigma
So bitch-ass niggas better step, like the Delta Sigma Thetas
We don't give a fuck, fools better duck
39 deep in the back of Wino's truck
Like robbin in the paint, fool think I ain't? 
Your crew is on stank, that's why I'm pullin rank
I rev like a motor float ON like a boat to
Kick a style like Tical from here to North Dakota
The ambassador of funk with amps in the trunk
And when it's time to rock a mic I won't be no punk
I bring death to the evil and power to the people
My name ain't Steve Miller but I Fly Like an Eagle
Don't play me for a chump, I get around like Gump
And I, got more con in my verse than Chuck
And you don't want no motherfuckin problems here
Cuz I can round up a posse like Paul Revere
Your whole crew'll get took out, turned out, shook out
Burned up like a cookout, so fools better look out
Fresh out the penalty box
Sportin a stockin cap, cut off dickies, and some high-top striped socks
The freestyle finatic pyschosomatic back at it causin static
With lyrics still as tight as a straight jacket
The last in line but one of the first to get wit cha
Bringin more terror to MC's than a Michigan militia
Click click boom, nigga fuck your crew
I's the chanky hip-hopper, takin over pissin in your stage monitor
Socket you think that you can fuck with mine in your wildest dreams
You best to wake up and apoligize
Niggas penetentiary yearn me cuz I, burn like Parker
But anyway, half of y'all couldn't see me with a pair of Blu Blockers
The lyrical night stalker stalkin at night in a pair of creased Khakis
Chuck Taylors, my pistol grip tight
Dub-C, that nigga from Westside MAAD Circle
Ay man!  Ay ay
What's up Wino? 
Uh like loc, it's like late, let's get the fuck up out of here
Are we out? 
Yeah yeah fuck it
Fuck it, MAAD Circle bitch!
As I walk through the valley of the shadow of Death
I take a look at my life and realize there's nothing left
Cause I've been blastin' and laughin' so long
That even my momma thinks that my mind is gone
But I ain't never crossed a man that didn't deserve it
Me be treated like a punk, you know that's unheard of
You better watch how you're talkin' and where you're walkin'
Or you and your homies might be lined in chalk
I really hate to trip, but I gotta, loc'
As they croak, I see myself in the pistol smoke
Fool, I'm the kinda G that little homies wanna be like
On my knees in the night sayin' prayers in the street light
Keep spending most our lives
Livin' in a gangsta's paradise
Been spending most their lives
Livin' in a gangsta's paradise
We keep spending most our lives
Livin' in a gangsta's paradise
We keep spending most our lives
Livin' in a gangsta's paradise
Look at the situation they got me facing
I can't live a normal life, I was raised by the street
So I gotta be down with the'hood team
Too much television watching got me chasing dreams
I'm an educated fool with money on my mind
Got my ten in my hand and a gleam in my eye
I'm a loc'd out gangsta, set tripping banger
And my homies are down so don't arouse my anger
Fool, death ain't nothing but a heart beat away
I'm living life, do or die, what can I say? 
I'm twenty-three now, will I ever live to see twenty-four? 
The way things is going I don't know
Tell me why are we
So blind to see
That the ones we hurt
Are you and me
Power and the money, money and the power
Minute after minute, hour after hour
Everybody's running, but half of them ain't looking
I's goin' on in the kitchen, but I don't know what's cookin'
They say I gotta learn
But nobody's here to teach me
If they can't understand it, how can they reach me? 
I guess they can't
I guess they won't
I guess they front
That's why I know my life is out of luck, fool
What you pullin' me over fo' mistuh offi-suh? 
I'll be askin' the questions Leroy
My name ain't Leroy, man
Heh, all right Jerome, outta the car
Man, why I gotta be Jerome man? Why can't I be Tommy or Philbert or something? 
Just put your hands on the hood Muhammad
I's the man that you love to hate
Coming outta Washington state
Cops don't like my profile
Cause Mixalot kicks much style
So the man is on my trail
He wanna take Mix to jail
If he does, I'll make the bail
Cause I know alot of rich females
I'm shakin''em just like this
Keepin' that Porsche in fifth
King County cops don't quit
Even when a young brothers legit
So they follow me wherever I go
I hear'em on the radio
With a scanner that I bought from the sto'
Cause a brother like Mix gotta know
I'm checkin' them cops with radar
They don't believe I'm a rap star
That my brain is up to par
An I'm ready when they follow my car
I know they wanna spray me with mace
Cause my trunk keeps pumpin' much bass
But they best get outta my face
Cause one-times got no case, give it to me
One-times got no case
The police think I'm movin' them keys
They trip cause I clock much D
They pull a gat an' they yell out 
Freeze! 
I'm whippin' out my I.D
My gat sits under my seat
The cops throw me out in the street
They found my gun like thieves
Officer Friendly has got a new beat
So I show him my gun permit
I told him I roll legit
Give me a test to see if I'm drinkin'
They claim my breath was stinkin'
They had me walk on the line
I walked backwards stopped on a dime
My female just reclines
Cause she knows I know the time
I'm hip to the cop procedure
They get ya everytime they see ya
They stop ya, they cuff ya
They roll ya an' they rough ya
They ask what I do for a livin'
Should this information be given? 
This is what keeps me driven
Some cops want a brother in prison
So I got me a few attorneys
Just in case a cop wanna burn me
They protect me from the state
Cause one-time's got no case, break it on down
A cop asks me 
What's my name, and don't lie
And I'm askin' officer 
Why? 
Why ya wanna mess with a brother like Mix
When you know I'm livin' legit? 
The cop said 
Don't get smart
I tear soul-brothers apart
I said 
Well take off your gun, if you wanna get done
An' I'll show you that I ain't the one
The cop rolled up his fist
Puts the handcuffs on my wrists
Then he threw a straight jab and he missed
A female cop pulls up and she's pissed
But this cop had K-9
A soul sister, yes she's fine
I said 
Won't ya help a brother outta bind? 
But that badge was going to her mind
So she stuck a billy club in my back
She said 
Don't think because you're black
That I won't beat you, crack, hit you with the gat
Her partner starts to laugh
Oooh, hit'em again. Hit'em again
So they took me on down to the jail
P.L.B. came to pay my bail
Then we called Goldstein and Claire
Them's my lawyers
Walkin' up the stairs
To the courtroom dressed in suits
'Bout to give a couple cops the boot
So the female cop takes the stand
Took her oath with the wrong damn hand
My lawyers ate her up like catfish
The other cop pleads the fifth
She lost her job
I seen a few tears on her face
Sorry baby, one-time's got no case
Mack Daddy
Ain't you tired of that gameless mark smackin' you in your face baby? 
Mack Daddy
You better roll with the big mack, the man with the game
Mack Daddy
Gotta big snake, all you gotta do is make it dance, you know what I'm sayin'
Mack Daddy
I'm rollin' to another neighborhood
Me'n my boyz, up to no good
Chasin' miniskirts'n the ride is packed
Rollin' to a mall called Sea
Tac
Cruisin''n the cops don't like that
'Round the mall once'n don't come back
Four-door Rolls with the black exterior
Turbo Bentley, white interior
A Rolls Royce fulla big black men
In the suburbs, messin' with citizens
Walkin' in the mall, looka how I spit
Sloppy dressed brothers make the females blitz
Big long starters, black low tops
Mack daddy hat got me lookin' like Pops
But that's cool, cuz, I'm mackin' anyway
'N your females my prey
'N I'm callin' out skirts like Chuck D
Sista we missed ya, get wit' me
Comin', runnin, your boyfriends gunnin'
The big boss is so cunnin'
Some of my home boys hate me
They get a microphone, then try to take me
But you ain't slip, sayin' what's up Mix? 
Boy I'm hip to your tricks
I'm the Mack Daddy
Mack Daddy
Yeah ain't no reason to bet ya
Cause I'm the Mack Daddy
Steadily mackin'
Mack Daddy
Kickin' in a buffed up Lamborghini
If your females proper she gots to see me
Cause I'm the king of the roll outs
Mack Daddy is back still runnin' my mouth
I see a freak on the Sea
Tac strip
My Lamborghini's brakes get grip
So I pull up on to The Spot
I start frontin', cause I wanna get jocked
Topped off the gas, whipped out my cash
'N one girls starts to laugh
But I'm still smooth
'N my game is on, so I make my move
Say, you in the white pants
I'm a step close to ya, but I won't dance
'N what you laughin' at
All the girls start pointin' at my hat
'N I'm a giggle wit''em, cause I just wanna get wit''em
I don't hit'em, I just wanna stick'em
So I pull baby girl to the side
She said she likes my car
I said take a ride
So we flipped up the doors on the Contach
But gettin' in a Lamborghini is hard
So I grabbed baby girl by the rear end
I thought she might need help gettin' in
So I clos' the do'
'N now you kno'
Mack Daddy is about to sco'
The girl said, baby you can have me
So I stopped at the tail
Cause I'm the Mack Daddy
Mack Daddy
All you all gameless marks know
Mack Daddy
I'm the Mack Daddy
Mack Daddy
Yew
I don't smoke no weed, but I like to G
I don't mean O.G., I mean sex baby
Cause a brother like me don't date
I sling records'n tapes
The Rhyme Cartel with the Def American
Gettin' brothers sprung like Farrakhan
'N I'm stuffin' my ladies pumps
In the backa my Benz I humps
I'm nasty'n proud
To hell with cool, I'm G'in''em loud
Other people at the hotel gets no rest
Cause Mix-a-lots bumpin' them headrests
She got booty for days
Other brothers is pullin' up, but she ain't phased
Cause I laid my game like a concrete slab
She's the kinda skirt a mack gotta have
Rollin', showin' her off
'N some fool tried to call me soft
He's in a one nine seven two skin head caddy
A old superfly mack daddy
So my girl stepped out'n he tried to mack
But she ain't havin' that
You see your game is weak, G
My girl, I ain't slappin', I'm mackin'
'N rappin'
Mack Daddy
I'm the Mack Daddy
Mack Daddy
I'm the Mack Daddy
Mack Daddy
Come over here and get some of this snake
Mack Daddy
I'm the Mack Daddy
Oh, my, god. Becky, look at her butt
It is so big. She looks like
One of those rap guys' girlfriends
But, y'know, who understands those rap guys? 
They only talk to her, because
She looks like a total prostitute,'kay? 
I mean, her butt, is just so big
I can't believe it's just so round, it's like
Out there, I mean - gross. Look! 
She's just so... black! 
I like big butts and I can not lie
You other brothers can't deny
That when a girl walks in with an itty bitty waist
And a round thing in your face
You get sprung, wanna pull up tough
Cause you notice that butt was stuffed
Deep in the jeans she's wearing
I'm hooked and I can't stop staring
Oh baby, I wanna get wit'cha
And take your picture
My homeboys tried to warn me
But that butt you got makes 
Ooh, Rump-o'-smooth-skin
You say you wanna get in my Benz? 
Well, use me, use me
Cause you ain't that average groupie
I've seen them dancing
The hell with romancing
She's wet, wet
Got it going like a turbo'Vette
I'm tired of magazines
Sayin' flat butts are the thing
Take the average black man and ask him that
She gotta pack much back
So, fellas!  Fellas! 
Has your girlfriend got the butt? 
Tell'em to shake it!  Shake it! 
Shake that healthy butt! 
Baby got back! 
Baby got back! 
I like'em round, and big
And when I'm throwing a gig
I just can't help myself, I'm acting like an animal
Now here's my scandal
I wanna get you home
And ugh, double-up, ugh, ugh
I ain't talking about Playboy
Cause silicone parts are made for toys
I want'em real thick and juicy
So find that juicy double
Mix-a-Lot's in trouble
Begging for a piece of that bubble
So I'm looking at rock videos
Knock-kneed bimbos walking like hoes
You can have them bimbos
I'll keep my women like Flo Jo
A word to the thick soul sistas, I wanna get with ya
I won't cuss or hit ya
But I gotta be straight when I say I wanna *fuck*
Til the break of dawn
Baby got it going on
A lot of simps won't like this song
Cause them punks like to hit it and quit it
And I'd rather stay and play
Cause I'm long, and I'm strong
And I'm down to get the friction on
So, ladies!  Ladies! 
If you wanna roll in my Mercedes 
Then turn around! Stick it out! 
Even white boys got to shout
Baby got back! 
Baby got back! 
Yeah, baby... when it comes to females, Cosmo ain't got nothin'
To do with my selection... 36-24-36? Ha ha, only if she's 5'3
So your girlfriend rolls a Honda
Playing workout tapes by Fonda
But Fonda ain't got a motor in the back of her Honda
My anaconda don't want none
Unless you've got buns, hon
You can do side bends or sit-ups
But please don't lose that butt
Some brothers wanna play that hard role
And tell you that the butt ain't gold
So they toss it and leave it
And I pull up quick to retrieve it
So Cosmo says you're fat
Well I ain't down with that! 
Cause your waist is small and your curves are kickin'
And I'm thinkin' about stickin'
To the beanpole dames in the magazines:
You ain't it, Miss Thing! 
Give me a sista, I can't resist her
Red beans and rice didn't miss her
Some knucklehead tried to dis
Cause his girls are on my list
He had game but he chose to hit'em
And I pull up quick to get wit'em
So ladies, if the butt is round
And you want a triple X throw down
Dial 1-900-MIX-A-LOT
And kick them nasty thoughts
Baby got back! 
Little in the middle but she got much back!
Hey, homeys! 
Who me? 
Yeah, that's right. You the fly hustler.
Ya'll still sellin' that fake Louie, huh? 
Hey! Don't be turnin' the highside up in here. You don't even got the
Dope...
Oh, baby, I don't need the highside, just give me some khaki's and I'm
Straight.
Tryin' dis me, ole raggy rooty-poot runned up gangsta? Who you think you are? 
M.C. Hammer? You can't'ford this Louis Vuitton! 
What you mean I can't afford it. Why would I wanna afford some old fake
Louie, baby
If that's real Louie, I'm Tom Cruise.
Excuse me, I'd like to buy some.
You don't know jack about this Louie. Take your sorry self over booth
Number 2 for
The crack pipe.
Yeah, awreit. I got your crack pipe right here baby.
*RAP*
Wooah, Louis Vuitton never made a sweatsuit
But you're swearin' up and down, that you got the Louie boots
So you roll to the swap meet, girlfriend buttless
Rip phantom top on your seven six Cutlass
In the shop Louis Vee is what you seek
Black Knight Cortez slippin' on your feet
You're saggin', droop like a bawla
Your girl starts walkin' towards the counter, so you call her
Oooh, this is on. Why don't you get this for me? 
Everytime you hit the swap meet, it's gimme, gimme, gimme
A little old lady in the back starts to creep, she's deep
Through cazelley's she peeks
Her name is Mary Pong and she's got it going on
Swap meet weed, with the swap meet thongs
Leather miniskirt with the oriental draw
Little Mary Pong is RAW
She says 
I wanna make your girlfriend look good
Start buying all your Louie in the hood
And your sprung, on the two for one
Fake Louie at the swap meet, son
Now you know brown Louie is played
But you're drunk and you just got paid
So you bought the gear, little Mary says 
See ya
Little did you know it was 
Made in Korea? 
Swap Meet Louie, Swap Meet Louie
That's right, tell em homeys
Swap Meet Louie, Swap Meet Louie
Right here baby
Swap Meet Louie, Swap Meet Louie
What you need? 
Swap Meet Louie, Swap Meet Louie
You don't know jack about this Louie
Victim number two, a rich young couple from Bellevue
Welcome to the swap meet, another dumb couple'bout to get beat
Out came little Mary Pong, she had the big Louie Vee gear on
The couple got sprung and the wife want some
Louie Vee hat with the diamonds
Shes thinkin' she got that deal, 2 for 1 is a steal
The hat mighta had a L V on the back
But at the swap meet that ain't jack
But she bought it, cost about three hun
Mary Pong said you're the one
But when the girls Louie got wet she started complainin'
Baby girls Louie started fadin'
Now she's tryin' to take it back
But the swap meet don't play that
Cause when a customer tries to intimidate
Mary Pong pulls a.38
She ain't about to get bum rushed
She's strapped an' she's ready to bust
But at the swap meet you don't pay tax
They're movin' out fake Louie by the batch
Swap Meet Louie, clockin' lotsa dolla's
Swap Meet Louie, we all got gold
Swap Meet Louie, black silk jackets
Swap Meet Louie, rich flaunt clout
Swap Meet Louie, Swap Meet Louie
Swap Meet Louie, Swap Meet Louie
Me an' Attitude Adjuster stepped smooth at a swap meet
Buyin' much gear for the feet
When we spot Mary Pong with a blank face
Sellin' bootleg Mixalot tapes
The brother bought the tape and kept steppin'
Mary Pong starts lookin' for a weapon
I got a plan'n' I'm about to use it
What's up with the bootleg music? 
Mary Pong is about to get jacked
She had a stack of big bootleg racks
Me and Attitude creeped like snakes
Grabbed the tapes and the Louie and break
The whole swap meet went crazy
I'm sockin' more fools than Patrick Swayze
Toss a mess of fake Louie in the trunk
Hit the gas and the tach just sunk
Like that, I'm outta there
Swift brothers like to roll in pairs
So we jet, to the boulevard fast
Slingin' swap meet Louie for cash
Swap Meet Louie, Swap Meet Louie
That's right, tell em homeys
Swap Meet Louie, Swap Meet Louie
Right here baby
Swap Meet Louie, Swap Meet Louie
What you need? 
Swap Meet Louie, Swap Meet Louie
You don't know jack about this Louie Yo Attitude!
We got some bustin' ass marks out here claimin' some muthafuckin' place they ain't never seen
Huh, sellout
Boy this is the S-E-A-T-O-W-N, clown
Forever!
Yeah, and that's from the motherfuckin heart!
So if you ain't down witcha hometown, STEP OFF PUNK!
Mix, tell these fakes what the deal is
I was raised in the S-E-A-double T-L-E
Seattle, born in the C.D. nigga
19th and Yesler boy da pimpin' was hard
Cadillac was the car I wanted
And I got that seven-seven Coupe with the trues and straps
I couldn't roll no hubcaps, huh, it wasn't easy
Tryin' to compete, with my homies in the C.D
Here's my plan, funky-ass sedan
Laid down with the vogues, money in my hand
Hair all whipped up
Carload full of freaks with the butts
I used to cruise around Seward Park
Flip the funky eighty-one, and La Vista
Lookin' for freaks to be G'd
Most mini-skirts wanted please
In them days boy you had to be pimpin'
Just to keep motherfuckers from trippin'
Now punks wanna run up pokin'
With a nine double-M, is you jokin'? 
Cause I'm packin' - a HK-91 son
308's is what I run
A lot of clowns tried to take this town but they didn't
Huh, cause Seattle wasn't bullshittin'
It ain't nothin' but the real up in the Northwest 
So don't step to the 2-0-6 tryin to kick up dust
Or you might get floored, sucka , think about it
This is from the Attitude Adjustor
Do we got gangs? Hell yeah, brothers gotta get paid
Mickey D's ain't payin' no way
So they take to the streets with gats
And they'll put'em on ya just like that
So I'm undercover, when I'm rollin' through the C.D
A lot of niggas wanna get me
I see a freak in front of Garfield, I swoop around the block
Gang of niggas yellin' out, 
Fuck Mix-A-Lot! 
Do I hate'em? Naw, I gotta love'em
They think my head is big, and I'm tryin to be above'em
Huh, but to the masses I'm just another coon
Gettin' paid for a little bit of boon
So even though a lot of niggas talk shit
I'm still down for the Northwest when I hit
The stage, anywhere U.S.A
I give Seattle and Tacoma much play
So here's a shot to the Criminal Nation
And the young brother Kid Sensation
I can't forget Maharaji and the Attitude Adjustor
And the hardcore brothers to the West of Seattle
Yeah, Westside
High Pointe, dippin' fo'-do' rides
And my homeboy Critical Mass in the back
With the bat to smack back all packs who try to jack me
Just because I'm in a S-E-C
Droptop A-M-G
The cops say Mix-A-Lot's a dope dealer
But I'm more like a dope deal sealer
I sell rap deals, not drug deals
Handin' out contracts like meals
The Rhyme Cartel, I own the muthafuckin' label
And Ricardo got the papers on the table
And I'm signin''em, just like that
No sluts so my pockets stay fat
A lot of clowns tried to take this town but they didn't
Huh, cause Seattle wasn't bullshittin'
Huh, nigga this is MY town, what you talkin'? 
Punks tryin' to tell me where I come from!  Who the fuck you talkin' to, clown? 
Need to shut the Hell up, Seattle Tacoma strong
Shit, you was a young lil' rudy poot muthafucka'fore you picked up a nine millimeter! 
Who you smokin'? 
Punk ass, cake, faggot ass nigga! 
Let's take a trip to the South end, we go West
Hit Rainier Ave and bust left
I'm in a funky-ass Porsche Gemballa
No bitches, just women on my collar
S-E-A-T-O-W-N
Yo' nigga is back again
Huh, who you callin' sellout fool? 
I was puttin' caps in clowns when you was still in school
But I choose not to talk about that
So many gangsta crews now, I'd rather kick back
So I drop my own style
Fuck bitin' somebody else, and jumpin' on a pile
But that's another subject, gettin' back to the hood
Me and my boys is up to no good
A big line of cars, rollin' DEEP through the South end
Made a left on Henderson
Clowns talkin' shit in the Southshore parkin' lot
Critical Mass is beggin' to box
But we keep on goin' because down the streets
A bunch of freaks in front of Rainier Beach, was lookin' at US
They missed that bus, and they figured that they could trust us
Six cars in a line and the girls was fine
I had 
The Wicked One playin' on my Alpine
Two Porsches, two Benzes, a Ferrari Testarossa
And a Rolls Royce roaster
Miami Vice tried to get with this, but they didn't
Huh-huh, cause Seattle ain't bullshittin'! 
Yeah I wanna whassup to my DJ Punish? 
My boy Strange, across the water whassup LX? 
Bookie, Mark P, MC Fury
The Group EQ, old forty ounce drinkin' A.D

Everybody in Seatown and T-Town!Your silence is my trade
Lockjaw!  Your silence is my trade
Givin' MCs lockjaw!  Your silence is my trade
Lockjaw!  Your silence is my trade
I'm givin' MCs lockjaw!  Your silence is my trade
Here we go! Oh no
Another flow show from the young black dynamo
Lockin' up jaws, MCs pause -
No lyrical flaws
Hush, when the boss is talkin'
Lay down gats and get your weak knees walkin'
You ain't allowed to speak cause you've reached your peak
The elite don't get with the weak
Shut up, cause I'm burnin' this cut up
Boy, don't try to run up
Cause I chop up crops
A weak hip-hop boy tried to jock my spot and he flopped
He went down to the concrete ground
I'm a hound when I get down
And I'm back, the mack with a lyrical knack
To pack sacks and never pay tax
And when I leave they diss me
Knowin' they can never get with me
But he who laughs last gets the most cash
And lives the blast past of rap trash
Gone! Left ya, son
Gimme a call when you're done
Your silence is my trade, shut up! 
Your silence is my trade
Lockjaw! 
Your silence is my trade
Givin' MCs lockjaw!  Your silence is my trade
Run, run, run, your time is done, son
Move out for the well-hung young one
And I'm rackin' up stacks of greenbacks -
Dead presidents, black! 
Peace to my fans and I love ya
And I got yo' cover
Cause I'm back to please
And cool off the hot MCs
Cause they're runnin' around like ants, tryin' to grab their pants
That shit don't make you dance! 
What's this beat doin'? 
Leavin' your posse ruined
Stuck my fist in his mouth
Caught him on a whole shout
No pity on the lyrically weak
Face defeat, retreat, but don't speak
Cause I ain't through, fool
And you ain't true to the Mix rules! 
You try to flow so you go for what you know
But yo, bro, you ain't the flow pro
I can't go slow
Gotta grow cause I wanna get mo' dough
Full blown, bad to the bone
And known to get it on with a microphone, homes
Leave my throne alone
I've been to the low zone
Your silence is my trade, shut up! 
Your silence is my trade
Lockjaw!
Your silence is my trade
Givin' MCs lockjaw!
Your silence is my trade
Come on, Punish! 
Punish! 
Your host on the coast is known to boast
And roast most that choose to get close
Put'em in a lyrical knot
My spot: the #1 slot
But I gotta have beats
When I lyrically de-feat the weak that try to compete
Get'em up, if you wanna go head-up
What up? Do as I instruct, black
Cause my gat is jack-backed
And lookin' at your baseball hat
I rolled over that mess you stole
And took control, and then broke the mold! 
Now here I stand, boss man
The North
West tip is where I am
And I'm runnin' this work like dope
Shippin' it in planes, trains and boats
Up the charts I go
Steppin' on toes and throwin' low bolos
My group is large, and hard
No need for a bodyguard
We flex, rippin' off MCs' necks
Run'em into Critical's pecs
Your silence is my trade, shut up! 
Lockjaw! Your silence is my trade
Givin' MCs lockjaw! Your silence is my trade
Come on, Punish! 
Punish'em! 
Punish! 
Punish'em! 
Lockjaw! 
Givin' MCs lockjaw! 
Lockjaw! 
Givin' MCs lockjaw! 
Lockjaw! ShhhBoss
Boss
We have such sights to show you
This isn't for your eyes...
Aaa
AAAA, the boss is back! 
Boss
The boss is back! 
Boss
Boss
So I took a one-year hiatus
Ain't nobody heard my latest
You thought Mix-a-Lot was through
But I'm back; this boot's on you
What happened to all the old homies? 
When the money gets funny it's lonely
My ex turned into a slut
Down at the Hollywood, slangin' that butt
Cheap perfume and a mini-skirt
Girl, what's your line of work? 
Now that I'm rollin', you wanna roll with me
But have you been to the clinic lately? 
Yesterday you had six condoms, see
Today you got three
Tossed you out like a paper sack
This brother ain't Sprung On The Cat
What about all the old homies? 
I got paid so they call me phony
But I refuse to lay it low
When a brother like you tells me I can't flow? 
So here we go, bro, the leader of the Flow Show
Let you know, I roll and get mo'
I yank the bank and I ain't been ganked
Cause my back you're trying to shank, but no thanks! 
My face shows pain and strain as I stand in the rain
With this fame, you go insane
The game I run is not fun to some
And now I love no one! 
The boss is back! 
Big boss in effect, I ain't bluffin'!
 I'm back! 
Your boss is back! 
Big boss in effect, I ain't bluffin'!
Big boss in effect, I ain't bluffin'!
Tommy wants revenge
But I want your oxygen
When the game got thick you ran
Now in my face you stand
Beggin' for a few hun? 
Son, your fun meets my gun! 
Now you scream you're true black
Boy, you need to chill with that! 
Cause I'm an e-qual op-por-tu-ni-ty de-stroyer
My gat's my lawyer
Last week you's a stick-up kid
And this week you're in show biz
Standin' on stage, another black wanna-be
Wanna get paid, so you're as balck as you gotta be
Throw up a peace sign, fakin' the rhymes
Run out of lyrics, scratch in a Malcom X line
Hypocrite, your hits break the bits
The boss of brain lays pain when I spit
Criticized, cause I'm takin' the dares
And now you're tryin' to tell another brother what to wear? 
Come off that tip, you know how it goes
Another brother gets shot and punks blame it on gold
Gold ropes?  Naw, that ain't your problem
The job of a rapper is to find em and solve em
Now you're crying bout what a brother owns
King died so you could buy your throne
I ain't got time to take steps in reverse
You or the KKK, who's worse? 
You told me to stay low in my ghetto
And so did the Klan, so wake up, bro
Why do you think brothers is sellin' dope, fool? 
America, boy, the bankroll rules! 
Play that hard role and say you ain't with that
And everything you're cryin' bout money on your contract
Talked about me bad, it's time for the payback, black
The boss is back! 
I'm back
I don't know the meaning of trust
I gotta live so I do what I must
Some girls'll cross you when you're soft
That's why I'm my own damn boss
They'll run you down with stress
If you're spring on the butt and chest
I'd rather be sprung on the ducat
And put another damn freak in my bucket
I deal with women, not girls
Cause them young ones'll shake your world
I got about two or three clowns
That try to kick me when I'm down
But when I come up, they all play dumb
All of a sudden, it's we, not one
I zip up lips when I spit these hits
I'm equipped to make misfits quit
Young bucks should all duck cause jaws are gettin' struck
The luck gets chuched, so wussup! 
I ram and cram my jams in the mouth of a man
I'm kickin' quicker than Van Damme
Face the facts, two platinums stack
Step off, fool, or get cracked! 
The boss is back! 
Who's the boss? 
I'm back! 
Who's the boss? 
The boss is back! 
I'm your Testarossa. First gear
Watch me go, keep'em in fear
Rumble, young man rumble
Brother won't fumble, muthafukas just crumble
Gaskets crank, rappers get spank
Stripes get yank, a superior rank
Won't stop the jock in some American car use a lyrical radar
But I'm rolling, the cartel's tolling
For the D's keep folding
Most Cadillac rappers get look and disturb
By the jet black blur
Me, the Testarosa running like it suppose ta
Don't try to get closer
Cause you might get lost in the dual exhaust
Don't ever try to fuck wit' a boss
High octane there ain't no ping
When I swing on a lyrical speed king
And that's just first gear, listen for the upshift
Who can get wit' this
I'm your Testarossa
Second gear, look it here queer
I'm in here, hitting like spears
The rhyme cartel slings legalized dope
Some cope, others get 
Lost on the boss, it's finish is flawless
12 cylinders listen to the horses
It accelerates smooth
Move or else get move
Run for cover my brother, suckers are getting smothered
I cutted you other smutters rammed in the gutter
My rep is kept, muthafukas must step
The best get swept and let out to rest
Huuuu, look at that air intake
Second gear, passing fakes
Revolution per lyric get higher
How can I chill when my rhyme's on fire
As I approach the end of my tach
My lyrical horse power blows to the max
Red line is reached to the peak of my speech
And I told ya, I'm your Testarossa
Testarossa
Gear number three, get off the clutch and don't let'em up
Keep'em all down on these young bucks
Let'em know big boss is just a bit quicker
Get the picture
Backtalk tolerated none, son
Left you at the gun when I hit gear one
Now I'm in third and you think that's quick
Huh, wait till I hit fifth
Me and my pack, we keep plenty of snackpacks
You said fat now I'm yo to the max
Want Mix-A-Lot for your next attack
Hey, yo, critical mass, yea, I got your gat
Two hundred sixty pounds of pure pain
Critical mass is my homeboy's name
My personal trainer, taking weight gainer
Got the bulk to crush and contain ya
On the tach, I'm like a wind ax
Cutting up air like Boeings aircraft
Time to shift and let my lyrical seatbelt hold ya
I'm your Testarossa
Up to fourth gear, the speed increase
Police got beef wit the word chief
Move or lose, I excuse the wack dudes
You light my fuse and clear out or get used
I go 100 in a 55
No need to lip synch, I'm straight out live
So I'm rough lust who wanna be tough
You fuss and cuss wearing that Raider's stuff
Fake fools from around the way
Knowing damn well, you ain't from LA
Ashamed where you come from son, so you rattle
Like it or not, I scream straight up Seattle
Rip up streets wit a lyrical sweet
Don't peep or creep or you lose your freak
The cam's growl, engine loud
My tongue keep beating'em down
Rev it up, get ready for fifth
Just hit'em wit a maximum dis
I roll ya, fold ya, mold ya, I told ya I control ya
And I'm your Testarossa
I'm your Testarossa
Yo Punish, show'em what time it is
Gear number five, you're eyes get wide
So realize that I survive and I rhyme for mine
I rope the dope and is he coming up, nope
I ain't the joke so don't hope for my throat
There it is, the whiz gets his
The word quiz is what it is and Mix don't give
Sight to the wack who act like Max
And try to jack a pop rap to hit the map
That ain't like me, it ain't cool
To rob another fool them claim you rule
You boot but not me, troops, you like juice
So you hit the stage wearing my boots
Uh , uh cupcake, I ain't about to get rape by fake
Just look at the tail light shrink and then think
How I left you pink in a lyrical kink
Time to drop to my gears and then stop
'Cause I lock the box on them clowns that jock
Turbo cone is 230 up on ya
I'm your TestarossaI'm rollin' in a Nine-Oh van
California, that's my plan
Got memories Mix-a-lot left in limbo
First stop Sacramento
Here we go, hit a club called Bentley's
Want a skirt to git wit' me, hit me
There's a girl with a back like a Cadillac
I walked up and got pushed back
Her boyfriend tell her I'm a play-a
Dropped salt on a dope rhyme say-a
My reputation offends this man
Next day hit William Land Park
Creepin' like a shark
Spot a bad freak and I swoop like a hawk
What up? , 
Howya like to roll wit' a champ? 
Please! All ya'll rappers is tramps
My reputation is stoppin' my mission
Every freak in Sac is dissin'
Back on the four lane freeway
Next stop, the two-one-three, L.A
The two-one-three is rough
But the Mix-a-lot game is tough
Spot a young girl and I start that gamin'
Baby girl asks what set am I claimin'
Just cuz I rap, I gotta be in gang? 
It ain't a black thang, it's a rap thang
Censorship is sweepin' the nation
Messin' up a rap stars reputation
A rappers reputation, that's what I got
I got a rapper's reputation
So I'm finished with the two-one-three
I knock, baby, but it's time to leave
Two days on the hard rock, boys is cruisin'
Interstate Ten, straight to Houston
They tell me'bout the girls in the fifth ward
You know the boys must score
So we hit a fly club called Guchies
Lookin' for the skirts with the largest booties
Girlies in the club wasn't takin' no shorts
Showin' no remorse
For a brother like Mix, lookin' for the smooth
Didn't need a Houston skirt to get with me
But the nights still young
And the hunk ain't done
So we stepped to the van
Attitude's out of it
The next club, The Main Event
We never think about a dress code
Just step up in the club and let the game roll
But as soon as my boy Maharaji pulls up
Some punk starts runnin' up
He said you don't wanna be with a rap star
They play you for your money and your car
Well my boy got crushed but the girl stepped off
With a rap stars rep, the girls are lost
Hey yo, what's up, this is Mix I had to make a run
Right quick, but leave your name and number'n I'll
Getcha right back, peace.
So the posse left Houston Texas
All the girls keep callin' us sexist
Houston media is givin' us rappers no pity
So we all hit Kansas City
In K.C. we go The Gates and Suns
Gotta get grub'fore we run
Met a little freak named Stacy
I said I'm not just here for the Barbecue baby
She gave me that look, like Pebbles
I'm acked with bass not treble
So I say, Oogley-goo oogley-doo-goo-doo
What'd you say?  I ain't tellin' you
You see the Mix game is laced with riddles
It ain't Monie, it's Mix in the middle
In walked my ex named Wendy
She got a fresh Dooney Bag
Cause she's tired of Fendi
Oooh, could a brother be busted
Because Wendy trusted, Me? 
An' ah told a lit'l lie'n
Said I was a loyal guy
Wendy got mad and she wants to dis me
In Kansas City
Wendy starts to groovin'
Hands on her hips and her hair starts movin'
She said the Mix-a-lotgame is phony
Just cause I said I'm runnin' girls like ponies
But talkin' that stuff is my occupation
That's how I got this reputation
A rappers reputation, got a rappers reputation
Bring it on down. A rappers reputation, bring it back
A rappers reputation, that's what I got. A rappers
Reputation, peaceArtist: Sir Mix-A-Lot
Mack Daddy
Sprung On The Cat
Brothers, we've messed over our sisters for years
I said for years
But now we're being messed over
I said now we're being messed over
You done fell in love with the cat
You know what I'm talking about 
The Cat
I'll get ya
Meow, meow, the cat will get ya
If you let it get wit' ya
Some brothers wanna spend alotta money
Just to get a little honey
But the honey gets runny when the money's funny
Cause I'm hipped an' a brother like Mix don't slip
Cause them girls will put that cat right on ya
And don't say I didn't warn ya
Go down to the beach
See the girls in bikini's
Wonder why you don't see me, brothers 
Should I preach 
Awreit, back to the beach
A O.G. from the hood
Went down to the beach but his game was weak
Met a sweet thing named Yolanda
She had the go mo-mo's on her brand new Honda
So my boy stepped up with a gangsta pitch
Better come on an' get wit' dis
A forty-dog in his hand and he's saggin'
But pretty soon the cat's goan tag him
Later that night, Yolanda got busy in the back
Of his big black Cadillac
The next day, the O.G. wasn't playin' no ball
Cause he took her to the mall
Buyin' everything from skirts to boots
Oh, speakin' a boots, yeah he knocked'er boots
But in the end another fool got jack
Cause he was sprung on the cat
Sprung on the cat, check it out
There's a brother named Dave in a Corvette
Had a job at the U.P.S
I ain't dissin' cause U.P.S. pays money
But Dave wants to kick it with the honeys, huh
He shoulda got'em a girl'n' settle down
But Dave wants to get around
Put the top down on the'vette
Hit the south side of Seattle
Lookin' for sex
Got a full pack of Seagrams under the seat
And boom, there it is...three freaks
Thick, walkin' with a natural switch
And Dave starts getting that itch, huh
You know a'vettes only got two seats
But Dave wasn't listening to me
All three of them jumped in the car
Hit Red Lobster and went straight to the bar
But them drinks ain't cheap out there son
Five dollars for one of them daiquiris
And Dave was treatin'
And the girls was sure'nuff eatin'
Two hundred dollars worth of fish
And Dave wants to make a little wish
A little something that he'd seen in a porno movie
Play BBD and said do me
At Daves house they left him in a cold sweat
He gave'em the keys to the'vette
Ooh, that's the wrong move, black
You must be sprung on the cat
Sprung on the cat
Sprung on the cat
Old girl named Joyce tried to put that cat on me two weeks ago
You mean she DID put that cat on you, you're talkin' to
Attitude, be straight with me man
I'm cruisin incognito
850i with the smoked out windows
An' I'm thinkin' I'm raw
When it comes to girls I done seen it all
Then along came a girl named Joyce
She had a black Corniche Rolls Royce
At the stop sign she did something with her tongue
Could Mix be sprung? 
Her cat was calling me
And I started rolling slowly
Pulled up to the bumper
Cause I wants to thump her
So she pulls up into Texaco
And I roll up slow and jump in the Rolls
Now I'm checkin' out the body
This hotty gotta body'n' I wanna get naughty
Followed her to the motel
Yes, motel, I'm too cheap for a hotel
Room deuce deuce deuce and it's time to get loose
I dipped in the juice
So what's up with the Rolls
Checked the registration
And the Rolls was stole
Baby girl tried to break with my keys and gat
But I ain't sprung on the cat
Don't pet the cat, if you just met the cat
If you're sprung on the cat
You might as well eat the cat
Sprung on the cat
Sprung on the cat
Maharaji over there all quiet
I think Maharaji be eatin' the cat
How'bout Attitude Adjuster
Attitude, you eatin' the cat or what? 
I think it's Critical Mass
Critical Mass be suckin' on that cat
Yo, P.L.B. I know you eatin' somethin'
ME? What you snackin' on?
In this country a man's home is his castle..
I've been jacked by the racist scum, and here I come
Klan, run - cause revenge is fun! And I'm that one
To make you tapdance with a shotgun
On Donahue they said they had weapons
Just to teach black people one lesson
But I ain't goin to your school of fools
So come here, and look at my tools! 
You can meet and greet the Glock 19 in your nostrils
I'll splatter your dreams
Plans to overthrow are left in limbo
Cause one loco bro chose to dispose of you
And your skinhead crew
I ain't a house nigga with a twenty-two
I dump a hollow-point slug in your windpipe
Try to breathe believe the hype
Cause this ain't the jungle fool
And I don't throw SPEARS, and I ain't leavin here! 
A Nazi and you ain't never SEEN Germany
But you was lookin for a enemy
So you found a young brother with cash
Crashed my glass, snatched my whole stash
Boy I'mma getcha back, like it ain't no thang
Show you what I learned from the gangs
Stack em up deep in a six-nine Deuce
Long range scopes for the whole damn group
Hangin outside a club called Moonshine
Waitin for the right time..
There he is, walkin in the Levi's blue cut
The Wicked One dropped two shots in his butt
I can't solve racism with a gat
But this is where my head's at - get em with a jack back! 
You ask me the niggers around here
Been treated awful bad for a long time..
I've been sayin this, I gotta fix em
I wanna fix em with a crucifixion
Nail em to a cross and burn em
BURN EM BURN EM BURN EM! 
I's been said that this would happen
Skanless skinheads jackin
All up in the crib insult for takin my force
I had to break North
The leader had a spraypaint can
And on my wall wrote,'Death to the black man'
Burned a cross in front of the hideout
Hopin they could get my race to die out
I'mma cause em PAIN, physical and mental
I speak slowly - through the temple
The Wicked One is talkin trouble
Blastin skulls into pieces of puzzle
Damage em so bad, they can't stop me
Not enough body left to get an autopsy
Skinheads, stakin em out
Bloodshed, takin em out
Caught one of em, Mix said, 
Go ahead
Thirty-eight, STRAIGHT to his forehead
I hit em hard and it hit the spot
I punish and plot with Mix-a-Lot
Now where's the leader at? Gotta get him back
Gotta get the gat, gotta get the axe
Call it a revengeful murderous pact..
Call it the jack back! 
Some things are worth killing for
They burned a cross in my yard, caught a brother off guard
But I can't cry, cause I'm HARD! 
They jacked another black, but this black wants payback
I rack up killin stats! 
Now I'm on the hunt with a 12-gauge pump
Massive hardware's in my trunk
Creepin low.. and slow
There's one - roll down the window
Whassup, FOOL? ! !  *buck buck buck*
It ain't done til the punk stops breathin;
Watch Kunta Kinte get even! 
It goes like that when a brother stays strapped
Couldn't get a job so I learned to rap
Livin kinda large and the skinheads hate me
Run up in my house and they tried to take me
Now I got the metal to his dome
A Desert Eagle, dipped in chrome
I got a black stocking cap yanked over my face
Anger is takin rationality's place
Hitler's in the house and I'm takin him out
He shouts but the barrel's in his mouth
Before I shoot, he wants to know if I'm white or black
I yank my mask - this has been a jack back! 
These boys were trained activists..
I'm not a slave but the Ku Klux Klan
And the Aryan Nation say I am! 
What's behind the skinheads out to getcha? 
The reincarnation of Hitler
Now I got a murderous attitude
I'm in a put em in a casket mood! 
Remember the days of slavery? 
They hung many black men from a tree
We fought to be free real hard
And the black man's freedom must not be scarred! 
Callin me an African Sambo
But after this, 
American Psycho
And I'll smoke any skinhead racist
With the black Glock that's in my fist
And the morgue'll be packed in body stacks
Memories due to the jack back
Caught the leader of the skinhead clan
You know the one with the spraypaint can
Drilled him with a crowbar *gargling* DIE! 
In the left ear, out the right eye
Then I took a knife to his chest
Carved a wicked message in a bloody mess
It was a warning for the rest of his pack
This nigga got him with a jackback! "*girl weeping*
WHAT'S WRONG, SWEETHEART? 
DON'T YOU WANT ME? 
YOU PAID FOR ME.  KNEEL TO ME
*rhythmic sniffing*
SMOKE ME.  BREATHE ME.  INHALE...
HA HA HA HA HA HA, I'M YOUR NEW GOD
She's only 16, she looks lost
Bought crack from the dopeman, and got tossed
Livin on the streets, smoked out
Perfect individual for me to bust out
You can sniff me, or you can puff me
But the girl shoulda known, you can't trust me
She's only 98 pounds and lonely
She calls to her God for help, and that's me
COCAINE, go ahead n' use me, heh heh
Momma won't know you're a junkie
Just put me in your pipe, light and SUCK
*deep inhale* Cluck cluck cluck! 
And while you're high, grab a 12 gauge
Jump back on the streets, in a crack rage
The only way out is the sucicide route
Put the gauge at your dome and TAKE IT OUT
Now I'm on the 6 o'clock news
All my movies get the rave reviews
60 Minutes had a special on me
The god called Crack is killin your society
Colombia is where I get picked
I can kill with a 90-10 split
I work through the week, my pleasure is pain
And I'm your new God
You can call me Cocaine
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha
Cocaine
Heh heh heh
Go ahead n' smoke me
Brothers throwin up a set to protect me
I'm worth a lot so money so respect me
Doin damage on the boulevard, just like that
*gunfire* Shoot'em over crack
Dope dealers would kill for me
Cause if ya sell me, I help ya live lovely
You want a Porsche?  Move a few ki's
Just remember that your God is me
The task force bum rushed one of my employees
A big score, 23 ki's
Now ya see another dopeman sink
And one young cop on the brink
The cop's thinkin bout pinchin
And alimony checks to his wife for the rent and
Kids, so the profit is slow
And he wants to make his bankroll grow
23 ki's just sittin in the back seat
I can make the best man weak
So the cop hits the streets to sell a little pain
Now the cop has a God
You can call me Cocaine
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha
Cocaine
Smoke this
Smoke it
Smoke it
The only way I can be stopped is with intelligence
And you don't get it, so that's irrelevant
So you die, or else go to jail
And I'm happy as hell
I tried to get a young kid but he just said no
Because of some sports hero
So I entered the hero's house in the form of a line
And let him snort one time
Now he'd dead, cause my dose was pure
Got him too quick for the cure
So the headlines read, 
Dope Made Another Hit
*sniff* Dead on the first sniff
Now the kid is lookin for another hero
I let him know the other fool was a zero
He hits the streets, lookin for a remedy
They introduce him to me
I don't need another junky, just a flunky
Besides, the little punk was spunky
So I put him in a fresh pair o' Dickies
Give him a beeper, and let him terrorize the city
Put him in a gang, teach him to slang
Another young punk deep in the game
He'll be lucky if he lives til' 18
And I'm his new God
You can call me Cocaine
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha
Cocaine
Go ahead n' use me
Smoke me
Hm hm hm hm hm hm
The police, urge people, to keep their guns locked up and unloaded
Congress today, seems on the verge of approving gun control
I's, time to fight back cause the new jack black macks
Ain't did SHIT about that, whack, jackin
And I'm packin
Cause I'm down for the bank I'm stackin
And in a straight up brawl I'll mall alla y'all
Ya try to crawl for Tylenol and I install
Big fists in your face, the blow is well placed
Spray'em with mace in case mace is his taste
Throw up the dogs, the competition is fogged
Cause he was smokin the yang, iced and drink the 8-ball
Drunk, stumblin, threw him with the lean
I sweep him, then attack the spleen
Play the congas on his backbone
He's funk baritone until I twisted his dome
Creep up on my house and try to roll me up? 
And got STUCK IN THE GUT with a black, Glock
And he starts to wobble
Self-defense is what I'm claimin, let's squabble
I pick up a pipe to take plenty of quick swipes
One grazed his dome and sliced his eye whites
I don't give a DAMN bout a stupid ass burgular
I's all circular
The dope dealer sells dope to the dope smoker
The smoker breaks in and tries to choke ya
But I ain't the one to run from ya son
This is MY HOUSE, and it's FULLA GUNS! 
I'm down for mine and my choke is nice and hard
When you jack the boss there ain't no holds barred! 
No holds barred
No holds barred
No holds barred
I'm crushin most hoods like Katie-dids
I'm pleadin guilty for the damage I did
This ain't about random violence
The  crept into my house, FUCK SILENCE
Now most punks wanna run for the stun gun
Fuck a stun gun, I got the big one
Forty-four mag, automatic, CHROME
Mercury-tipped bullets, melt the dome
I's the 1990's, and crack is
Talkin to the criminals, ever so subliminal
Some crackhead wants Mix-A-Lot dead
A jack move instead, another fool bled
I can't cry cause my tears are nearly froze
My interior's cold, it posess my soul
I'm on the paranoid tip
And each of my socks got a clip! 
When my house got robbed, a top notch job
Cops laughed while my mom just sobbed
9-1-1 only works for the rich ones
So I collect GUNS! 
So step right through if you're down for the wrong move
Most crews are moved by my twelve gauge BOOM! 
How can I love when I gotta
Protect my neck from a punk suspect? 
Gun control - I ain't wit it
They banned the AK and any fool can STILL get it
The innocent have been beaten, bruised and scarred
But for this citizen, there ain't no holds barred
It is an absolute infringement on my second amendment rights
No holds barred
When is this attack on gun owners going to end? 
No holds barred
Education, versus restriction
Hypothetical situation
Gun control starts sweepin the nation
Now you got a bunch of unarmed innocent victims
Gettin FUCKED by the system
Sittin at home with a butter knife, huh
Any fool could rape your wife
So what's up when the criminals can't be stopped? 
The only one with guns are the COPS
But it's hard for a brother to trust police
Huh, so the shit don't cease
So I go downtown to buy a hot gun
I hated criminals, and now I'm one
Because I bought a gat to protect my house
The cops wanna bust me out? 
So it's illegal to protect yourself? 
Hell, you either get killed, or you in jail
So when you vote
You better think about what I just wrote
And FUCK writin a note to yo' Congressman! 
You got the fool hired
Now help get the fool fired
A scary scenario
And I put it in your stereo
So when a fool tries to run up on my car
R.I.P., no holds barred
No holds barred
No holds barred
They take aim, at the law abiding citizen, instead of the criminal
